merit. On these, and not on his genius as an orator, rests his chief
title to fame. Beside these his achievements as a statesman sink into
insignificance. Yet literary fame was never the special object of
Cicero's ambition. Throughout his best literary period it is for the
law courts and the senate and the popular assembly that we find him
constantly yearning, and it is only when these are inaccessible that he
betakes himself to writing. His speeches arose in the main out of the
circumstances of his political career. These and the writings inspired
by his consular achievements are almost his only contributions to
literature from the time of his entry upon public lise to the time
when his prosperous course was checked by the circumstances that led
to his exile. When his wings had been clipped and he found on his
return in 57 B.C. that the ascendency of the Triumvirs and the jealousy
or indifference of the Optimates prevented them from growing again,
his energy found vent in literary activity. The three books De Oratore
were given to the world in 55 ss.C. The books De Re Publica were
begun in the summer of 54¹, and were in everybody's hands at Rome
in May, 51². The work De Legibus seems to have been begun in 52 B.C.
Cicero⁷s studies were interrupted by his government of Cilicia and the
subsequent outbreak of the Civil War. When he returned to Rome
towards the end of 47 he found no opportunity for a renewal of his
triumphs in public life in a state in which the senate and popular
assembly merely registered the decrees of an autocrat, and political
trials were for the most part conducted in camera in Caesar's presence.
Literature alone was open to him. His resunied activity was chiefly
directed towards the continuation of his works on oratory. The Brutus,
begui] in the latter part of 47, and the Orator, important works, were
completed in 46, as were probably the partitiones Oratoriae and the
Libellus de Optimo Genere Oralomm. His non-rhetorical works of this
year—the paradoxa, probably begun before 53 Bc, and the Lamiam
Catom'ssshad a political motive.

So far Cicero’s philosophical works‚ with the unimportant exception
of the Paradoxcz and the early work De lnuem‘z'one, had dealt with
oratory and the science of politics: his energy, when restricted to
literary work, was directed towards that department of literary work
which was most closely connected with the public life which he loved 3
its direction is now changed, and the beginning of 45 B.C. marks an
epoch in the history of his writings. His dissatisfaction with the
political situation continued3 the news of the battle of Munda, fought
on the 17th of March, reported in Rome on the 20th of April, 45,
