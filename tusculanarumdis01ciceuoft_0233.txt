book of the later edition and forty-eight
chapters of the second book of the earlier
edition survive. There are also some
fragments of the later edition. For all
details with ref. to the history and con—
tents of the two editions see Reid, Acad.
Introd. ἓ 4, pp. 28—51.

contentionibus: abl. of cause; ‘had
it not been stirred to activity by the con-
tests and disputes os the most learned
men.’ For uiguisset cf. Aen. iv. 175
‘ fama...mobilitate uiget.‘

ἓ 5. transferant: Bai. and Sff. follow
Wes. Em. Ι p. 7 in reading trafirant,
claiming support from Boetius⁷ comm. on
Cicero’s Topica where, towards the end
of Bk v, this passage sed lamen tantum
abest ut scribi.. mmiores nostri transtulere
(sic) is quoted, as are also the words nos
qui sequimur probabilia...sine iracundia
parati sumus. The form traskrant is
found in the Med. MS in Fam. i 4, 1, v 20,
3 etc. Cf. also Ktih. Gr. 1 ξ 210 p. 626,
28. The support of Boetius is not of
much value as his quotation is inaccurate
in several particulam, but the early cor-
rector of V reads transfirant. So far as
meaning is concerned, trany‘erant is
quite suitable‚ cf. ‘transtulerunt' below,
‘ traducta' ἓ 6 010.

quae quidem erant : the indie. is cor-
rect where definite things (as here def.
branches of literature) and not inde-
terminate members of a class are re-
ferred to.

ita..,ut: lit. ‘on such terms...that,'
for this limiting use of ita with ut cf.
Hand, Tursell. 111 p. 475.

ab humili...ad summum: the sub—
stantival use of summum is usual, cf.
Caes. BG. vii 73, 6 ⁴ stipites...ab summo
praeacuti'; the similar use of lmmili
here is due to the balance of clauses.

uenit ad summum: cf. Hor. Epp.
ii 1, 32 ‘uenimus ad summum fortunae.'

senescat: cf. Or. ii 2, 7 ‘ut laudem
eorum iam prope senescentem...ab ob-
liuione...uindicarem.’

philosophia nascatur: following upon
oratorum quidem we should have ex-
pected a contrasted main clause philo-
sophia autem nascitur (and Bent. proposed

plzil. nascitur) but Cic. has inaccurately

allowed the latter clause to become de-
pendent upon ut (cf. i 36, 88 11. 011 ⁴ con-
firmato illo’)‚ and this he has done the
more readily because this rise of philosophy
and the assistance lent thereto by him
were intimately connected with the decline
of oratory. To put a semicolon after
uideatur and take nascatur..,adiuuemus
...patiamur as ‘ imperative ’ (⁶ jussive ')
with Or. Sff. Hei. and TS. would give a
balance of clauses deficient in symmetry.
Cicero would have used a cum- or
quom'am-clause and not a coordinate
clause along with these verbs if that had
been the meaning intended.

nascatur Latinis quidem : quidem, by
emphasizing Latinis, serves to contrast
