are represented to have judged with
justice on earth and to have become
judges in the underworld after death.
There are numerous references to both
in Homer and elsewhere in Gk lit.
Aeacus and Triptolemus are more
closely connected with Athens, the latter
being celebrated as the inventor of the
plough and the first to sow grain in
Attica, and the former being famous in
connection with the neighbouring island
of Aegina. Aeacus is not referred to in
Greek lit. as judge of the dead except
by Plato l. d. and in Gorg. 523 e, while
Triptolemus is only referred to in the
Platonic original of the present passage.
But both are represented as just judges
on earth (cf. Hom.. Hymn to Demeter
153 for Triptolemus, and Pind. Isthm.
viii 48 for Aeacus); and this was the
circumstance that would make the meet-
ing specially interesting; cf. ‘conueni-
reque eos qui iuste...uixerint‚' and in
Plato l. d. 6καὶ ἄλλοι ὄσοι...δίκαιοι ἐγέ-
νοντο ἐν τῷ ἑαυτῶν βίῳ.’ Stallbaum on
Plato, here, observes ‘Quod Triptolemus
in numero iudicum inferorum ponitur 63
uidetur esse plebis Atticae opinio, quae
fortasse ex mysteriis Eleusiniis in uolgus
dimanauerat.’ And, as a matter of fact,
all four heroes here mentioned were con-
nected with the secret rites or mysteries
of their native places. See Riddell’s
note on Plato‘s Apol. 41 3.
