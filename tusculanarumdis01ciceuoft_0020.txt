(b) lee date of the Tusculum Dlspzclatiens.

The precise date of composition of the Tusculan Disputations cannot
be positively determined. The facts which bear upon the solution of
this question arez-Q

1. several references contained in the work itself3

2. the passage in De Diu. ii 1, 2—43

3. two allusions in the letters to Atticu53

4. the dates of composition of most of his subsequently written
philosophical works.

Taking these in detail :——

1. (a) the discessus of Brutus referred to in Tusc. Disp. i 4, 7 took
place on the 20th of July, 45 ΒΕ. Cicero was in his Tusculan villa from
the zoth to the 24th July and lest for Astura on the 25th. See the
commentary ad [eclam. The subjects of the five books of the Tusculan
Disputations are represented to have been discussed on these five days,
20th to 24th July, and the books were no doubt planned during those
days, as Dr O. E. Schmidt assumes1.

(la) The fourth book De Finibus is mentioned in Tnsc. Disp. V
11, 32 as lately read (quia legi tuum nuper quartum de E'm'bus). That
book was finished, as we have seen above, by the end of June, 45.

The facts which I have just stated in sections (a) and (h) above
suffice to discredit the view of Heine that when on the 28th and 29th of
May he writes to Atticus (Att. xiii 31 and 32> for certain books of
Dicaearchus, Cicero is collecting material for the Tusculan Dispu-
tations. That work had not then been planned. A thoroughly satis-
factory theory is given by O. E. Schmidt (Briefw. p. 375). The
materials referred to were wanted by Cicero for the πολιτικὸς σύλυ
λογος more Dicaearchi of Att. xiii 3ο, 3.

2. In De Diu. ii 1, 3 Cicero states that the three books De
Natura Deorum were completed (perfectis) after the publication of
the five books of the Tusculan Disputations‚ and he announces his
intention of adding a work De Fato. As he mentions the De Senectute

in ξ 3, that work was also written before the De Dim'natione2.
If we were to take the statement strictly that the Tusculan Dis-

² Diu. ii 1, 2. “Totidem subsecuti libri Tusculanarum disputationum res ad
beate uiuendum maxime necessarias aperuerunt.... ξ 3. quibus editis tres libri
perfecti sunt de natura deorum...quibus‚ ut est in animo, de fato si adiunxerimus,
erit abunde satis sactum toti huic quaestioni....interiectus est etiam nuper liber is
quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute misimus.''
