be said of you (i.e. individually, Cicero plays on the word tic—since you,
Brutus, with your principles and your supposed descent from the
exactor regum, would be the last man to desire a throne) 3 it could
be said of Tarquiu after his expulsion (for he wanted to recover the
throne, as is proved by the fact that he fought for that purpose),
but in the case of a dead man the expression is not even intelligible,
for lacking belongs to one who feels, and there is no feeling in the
dead.'⁷ Reprinted from the Classical Revl'ew, XVI pp. 34—5 (Feb. 1902).

(f) Nor can it be unpleasant to be without feeling, since there is
no consciousness of its loss, QQ 90, 91.

(g) There is no feeling in sleep, how then can there be feeling
in death? Q 92.

(ἡ) There is no evil in a premature death: the longest life is not
long: the ternis long and short as applied to life are relative terms,
QQ 93-4·

(i) Disregarding all the chauces incident to life let us look
for happiness to resolution and a virtuous course of life, Q 95.

Exaniples are furnished by Theramenes, Q 963 and Socrates,
QQ 97-1003 and by obscurer men, and by legions and companies
of common soldiers3 and by women; and by Cyrenaic philosophers,
QQ 101—2.

(le) Concern as to what may befall one’s corpse after death is
illogical, QQ 103—4, as are also all insults and outrages offered to the
corpses of enemies, and all connniseration of the unburied dead,
QQ 102—73 many regard certain special funeral rites as essential or
important, this too is illogical, Q 108.

Custom and public opinion may inipose some obligations upon
the stu-vivom, Q 109.

(l) The man who is conscious of a virtuous life will especially
meet death with calmness3 and he will be willing to die in the midst
of prosperity, since the pleasure to be derived from further good fortune
would not counterbalance the annoyance which the loss of prosperity
would bring with it, QQ 109-111.

EP1LOGUE. In the dissertations of rhetoricians instances are put
forward in which the immortal gods have decided that death is the
best thing for rnen, and dying for one's country is represented as fraught
not only with glory but also with happiness, QQ 1 12—116.

Death is therefore either to be desired, or certainly not to be feared,
since it is either a departure to our true and eternal home or a deliver-
ance from all consciousness of annoyance, QQ 117—9.
