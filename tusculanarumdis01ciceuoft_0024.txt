xx JNTRODUCTJON

The motives that prompted to such complimentary notice of Brutus
were various. ,

The friendship of the two men dated from before the year of Cicero's
proconsulship of Cilicia, when it was temporarily weakened by Brutus'
endeavours to induce Cicero to coerce the Salaminians of Cyprus to
pay off with exorbitant interest a loan that they had received from him.
After the battle of Zela, Brutus, by order of Caesar, sent to Cicero
the letter which let the first ray of sunlight into his long anxious
soul¹. On receiving this letter in autumn 47 B.C. Cicero began his
work De Claris Oratoribus.

Cicero and Brutus were in intellectual sympathy. Both were philo-
sophers of the Academic school, both were orators, both were students
and writers.

Brutus was also in favour with Caesar.

Dr O. E. Schmidt² holds that Brutus accepted Caesarism hoping to
succeed the childless despot‚ his mother Servilia also influencing him.

Brutus married Cato's daughter Porcia on the 22nd June, 45 B.C.
This event may have contributed to bring about the altered feeling that
found vent on the 15th March, 44 Rc.

Cicero's relations with Brutus are well treated ofin Dr Sandys'
Orator, Introd. liv-lviii.

In a well-known passage in a letter to Atticus (Att. xii 52, 3) Cicero
states the general plan upon which he wrote his philosophical treatises—
“’A7r6ypo.‹j>a sunt, ...uerba tantum anew, quibus abu7td0.⁷' And this
statement is in harmony with what we know as to the rapidity with
which Cicero wrote these works. We may therefore be predisposed to
believe that the material for most of Cicero's philosophical works was
derived from Greek sources and that he copied wholesale‚ with little
recasting‚ from the source or sources which he used in each instance.

As to the particular source from which Cicero obtained his material
