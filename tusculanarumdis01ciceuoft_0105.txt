The expression is formed upon patres
maiorum gentium, for whom see Fur-
neaux on Tac. Ann. xi 25. Reid is
probably right in finding some sarcasm in
the application of the expression in the
passage in the Academics: similarly

Asclepios in Arcadia, and Dionysos at

Callimachus, Hymn to J0ve 9. The im-
portance attached by the ancients to the
due performance of funeral rites and the
intense conviction entertained by each
family that 'their dead would haunt them
if these rites were neglected‚ constituted
a guarantee sor their persormance. Any-
one therefore who asserted (as Euhemerus
did) that any particular god had been a
man would be at once asked to point out
the tomb of that man. (Hence where no
tomb could be found the rationalisers in
some cases assumed that the man had

demonstrantur.. .traclantur : we should
have expected the same mood in each of
these two parallel clauses. α and u are
apt to interchange in Mss; so also are
a and e. 1 prefer to take quaere as= ⁴ seek
out,’ ‘inspect⁷ and not ‘inquire' The
indic. then necessarily follows. quaerc‚sc.
eos quorum etc. quae before tradanturis
most naturally taken as relative, not in-
direct interrogative. If we are to detect
any difference between the grammatical
positions of the two words we must take
tradantur as subj. of reported thought,
and suppose the appeal to A.'s reason to
render the word subjective.

quae tradantur mysteriis: on this
subject see Lobeck's Aglaophamus and
Do'llinger op. cit. i 125—202.

tum denique: different from tum
demum: lum deniqne herez'tlzen you will
realise‚ i.e. these preliminaries will fully
enable you to realise3 tum demum would
have meant only tlzen, then at last, you
will realise. Cf. i 31, 75, iii 31, 75. In
the former expression the emphasis is on
tum, in the latter it is on demum.

quam hoc late pateat, ‘this will enable
you to realise how widely this principle
applies.y

annis: abl. of measure, 1, 3n.; post. is
adverbial.
