s being silent and the t pronounced only
because a vowel follows.

certe Eurypylus hic quidem est: these
words would fuly be spoken by Patroclus
in the play when he recognised Eurypylus
whom they served to <introduce to the
spectators. Cic. perhaps extended the
quotation so as to include them for a
similar reason, as Evnypylus had not yet
been mentioned by name. Some have
supposed the words to belong to Cic.. not
to the dramatist.

XVII. §39⁴ hominem exercitatum:
Hei. supposes Cic. to utter the exclama-
tion as if he were a spectator watching
the play3 but this seems unnatural. Ι
take these words as K'uh. does, the constr.

nem (ἦῆ) and ezrercilmn is read by the
best MSS. Sff. might have added that,
while Ennius’ play was probably adapted
from a Greek play, the passage in Homer
is the ultimate source sor both: and
Patroclus in Homer utters words of com-
miseration sor the army similar in effect
to the reading wh. Sff. proposes. Cf. ΙΙ.
xi διό-818. TS. and others· read llo-
7777'772'777 exercitant and give the words to
Patroclus (c’.rc7·‹·7'l77777= iactatum, cf. exer-
cuit v 1, 3), but the fact that Eurypylus
had been wounded at a time when others
were falling fast would not make him in
the eyes of Patroclus a sorely tried man.

luctus: not 51101115 of pain uttered by
the wounded, as Κ1111. and others sup-
pose-the word never has this meaning—
but ‘los-sss ‘bereavement.' Though the
survivors may have been too busy to
mourn or even to notice their loss, each
comrade slain was a loss.

continuatur, ‘goes steadily on.' cf.
Tac. Anu. xiv 36 ‘stragem caedemque
continuarent.⁷

adferat: Or. VVes. Sff. read adfert
with no MS authority of any value. Sff.
thinks that adferat would imply that he
gave an 111151161- and also in addition gave
a reason, but the words would not seem
to imply this. Translate ‘observe how
free from lamentation is his answer, an
answer, moreover, which gives a reason
why....’
