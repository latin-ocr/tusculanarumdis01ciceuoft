Gen. An. ii 3 referred 10 above), yet Aristotle says in the 531116 place λείπεται δὲ τὸν
νοῦν μόνον θύραθεν ἐπεισιέναι καὶ θεῖον εἶναι μόνον. Hence 561101315 like Trendelenhurg
(on de An. iii 5, 2 p. 496) have asserted that ‘ita mens sola diuinitus in fetum intrat‚’
and R. and P. make a similar statement, ὲ· 337 note d, and Kampe (in Zeller p. 569
n. 3) 61311115 for νοῦς 3 substratum consisting of αἰθήρ.

Yet, if the opinions of these 5611011115 6311 116 inferred from Aristotle's 5131611161115,
they are nevertheless in contlict with principles which are an integral part os
Aristotle's system. I think it more correct to say that Aristotle 11115 left difficulties
unsolved 01· 11111011611611 rather than that he has made conflicting 5131611161115. Α11510116

questions concerning the νοῦς.

Zeller, p. 594, shews the difficulties which 116561 1116 assumption that νοῦς 6011165,
by the operation of natural 6311565, 6111161· from the αἰθήρ or from the deity, or 15
introduced by the deity by a creative act. For, since the αἰθήρ 15 incapable of
increase or diminution, and 115 eternal 611611131- 111011011 can never, without violence,
change into the centripetal or centrisngal rectilinear motion of the four so-called
elements, how could the νοῦς pass from the αἰθήρ 10 earth? The 531116 argument
applies with even greater force to the theory that the νοῦς proceeds, hy the operation
of natural causes, directly from the deity. Again, the theory that the 50111 15 111110-
duced, in each instance, by a creative act of the deity is opposed to Aristotle's
distinct assei-tion that the deity does not actively interfere in mundane affairs.

Cicero's knowledge os Aristotle's philosophy must have been slight and incomplete
as compared with that os the scholars above mentioned, and he may well have been
misled by many of Aristotle⁷s statements. Aristotle’s treatment of the animal wax-nith
is especially liable to mislead, and Zeller pp. 483—7' has much difficulty with this
point. In Gen. An. (referred to above) the animal warmt‘h is placed exactly where the
ψυχή, including the νοῦς, is placed3 and it is declared to be ἀνάλογον τῷ τῶν ἄστρων
στοιχείῳ 1.6. 10 1116 αἰθήρ. 11 is true that Aristotle does not assert the animal warmth
to be z'dentical with αἰθήρ 11111 only ἀνάλογον, 11111 even Ritter and Preller do not seem
to have observed the distinction, as they assert in their note on ἕ 333 that Aristotle
thinks that the fifth element is present in living things in the animal warmth.

What Aristotle means by ἀνάλογον may perhaps be inferred from Zeller⁷s remarks
on p. 4²3 and n. 1 there.
