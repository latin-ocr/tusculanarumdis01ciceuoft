striking out νεκυομαντεῖα, Bentley by
reading soi· faciebat, consulebat. Davies
adhibebat. Mo. early conjectured quae
meus amicus Appius lami faciebat, νεκρο-

cal rite by which ghosts were called up
and questioned, see L. and Sc. sub uoce.
All the above emendations are, in the
face of the MSS, too violent, except the
last, which Orelli adopted.

meus amicus Appius : Appius Claudius
Pulcher, Cicero‘s colleague in the augur-
ship, elder br. of Clodius; to him Cic.
addressed the letters ad Fam. bk iii.
For his superstitious rites etc. cf. Val.
Max. i 8, 10; Lucan, Phars. v 68 foll.

'm uicinia nostra: i.e. not far from
Cicero's Cuman villa.

Auerni lacus: there was a νεκυομαν-
τεῖον there, described in Max. Tyr„ Diss.
xiv 2 ed. Long, quoted in Mo. Cf.
Strabo v p. 374 and i p. 46.

The lake was between Cumae and
Baiae in the crater of an extinct vol-
cano. Dense woods surrounded it and
covered the mountain sides; mephitic
exhalations issued from the rocks. It
was regarded as an entrance to the
underworld, cf. Aen. vi 201, 237 sqq.
for the descent of Aeneas there. The
physical character of the place is now
greatly changed. Cf. Heyne’s Virgil,
Exc. 2 on Aen. vi.

unde animae... : the metre is the same
as in the three lines in the text above, of
which these two are probably a con-
tinuation. The source is unknown.

aperto ex ostio: the best mss read
apertae, apertf, aperte or operte hostio.
Hence Madv. conjectured aperto ex ostio
which has been adopted by Kl. Sff. TS.
Kuh. reads aperlo ostio, which is not so
close to the reading of the best MSS. For
ο final not elided but shortened (in
K'uhner's reading) cf. Virg. Geo. i 281
‘inponere Pelio Ossam' and 15, 34 n.
For ἔκ cs. Plautus passim. Bentley’s
corr. obscura umbra (perlae, adopted by
Dav. Hei. Ml. and Schiche, is the read-
ing of V manu secunda and other MSS,
and is in harmonyv‘ith Max. Tyr. xiv 2
(cited above) καὶ αὐτῷ ἀπήντα εἴδωλον
ἀμυδρὸν μὲν καὶ ἰδεῖν ἀμφισβητήσιμον
and with the popular idea with regard to
phantoms‚ but suggests a sceptical vein
not expected in an early poet. The
rhythm of the line and the isolation of
ostio would also be less natural.

Acheruntis: G R and five other mss
have alte or allf, and Nonius 191, 26 sup·
ports Acheruns as fem. in Pl. Capt. 996
‘nulla adaequest Acheruns atque ubi ego
fui in lapicidinis.’

salso sang-uine: I retain the reading
of the best MSS with Dav. Or. Hei. TS.
Ml. Schiche, but Ι think cassae may be
the true reading. Kuh. reads salso san-
guine; Mo. sanguine falso (to avoid the
dactyl in the 4th foot), but Bentley well
objected to falso sanguine ‘Durus et
ferreus poeta sit, qui sic loqui sustineat:
potius falso corpore: nam sanguis ne in
uiuentibus quidem uideri potest, nisi
uulneratis.' salso sanguine is harder to
dispose of. It is the reading of the best
MSS and of several editors, and the
epithet is applied to blood in two
