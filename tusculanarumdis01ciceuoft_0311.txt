EXCURSUS ll 243

since Cic. knew that, though Plato employed it in the l‘haedo (78 c), he elsewhere
made the soul triplex (cf. 10, zon.).

The argument from ἀνάμνησις requires the assumption that pre-existence is a proof
of immortality (for which assumption cf. Lactantius iii 18 non pulaum‘anl aliter
ficri posse ut supersint animae post mortem nisi uideantur fuisse aule corpora). This·
may perhaps to some extent account for the fact that though Cic. states the ‹loctrine
of ἀνάμνησις 116 does so with so little sympathy that his words, taken literally,
represent the 11ογ 10 have answered the questions on geometry because they were very
easy, not because he possessed ἀνάμνησις. And he confuses ἀνάμνησις with μνήμη,
using the same word (memoria) for both; and when he has got rid of ἀνάμνησις 116
takes up feats of memory as if these were something higher (cf. ξ 59 maiore ellam
quodam modo) and afforded strouger proof of his point. The argument from the
Scale of Existenee is treated 111 1116 same desultory manner. 11 seems plainly to be
implied,f0r otherwise the reference to the lower faculties ‹loes not contribute anything
to the general argument, since there was no question of the immortality of the vital
principle of plants, or of the ψυχὴ ἄλογος of animals, involved in the discussion. The
appetites and πει-510115 attributed in this section to the animus belong to the ψυχὴ
ἄλογος of Plato and, so far as they are not under the control of reason, they are not a
part of the Stoie ψυχή. 111 Ν.1). 11 11, 29 they are more correctly referred to:
‘habere in se aliquem principatum ut in homine mentem, in belua quiddam simile
mentis, unde oriantur rerum appetitus! For the Stoic soul with its (lominant part,
reason, aud its seven derivative powers, see 18, 4² n. on siue dissipantur. The Stoic
view with regard to the emotions and desires is given in Diog. L. vii 111 foll. They
are κρίσεις, judgments or opinions formed by the mind: λύπη is an 111-31101131 con-
traction of the mind3 φόβος 15 expectation of evil; ἐπιθυμία 15 an ἄλογος ὄρεξις,
and so on. They have therefore no separate seat and do not proceed from a special
faculty, but are merely wrong (1661510115 os the imperfect soul, cf. T.D. iv 6, 11 foll.
