L Ρ. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum·

was a grandson of Cn. Scipio who fell in
Spain during the Second Punic VVar, and
son of the Nasica who received the statue
of Cybele when it was brought from Pes-
sinus to Rome. He was son-in-law of
Africanus the elder, and was distinguished
in oratory and in law.

egregie cordatus homo..., a line from
Ennius* Annals, quoted three times by
Cicero.
⁷ Sex. Aelius Q. F. P. N. Paetus Catus

was consul in 198 B.C., as appears from
the Fasti Capitolini. This inscription

seems to shew that Catus was part of his ἡ

name, and not a mere attribute like
Sapiens in the case of Laelius Sapiens.
Cf. Moser’s n.

[Ι doubt the argument from the Fasti
Capz’t.; it attributes too much to their
authority. They were greatly influenced
by late antiquarian researches, such as
those made by Varro and Atticus]

Considerable fragments
Cic.

about 460 13.c.
of his poem περὶ φύσεως survive.
here makes E. declare the soul to be the
blood around the heart, a view actually
held by Critias the pupil of Socrates.
Cic. was probably misled by a line pre-
served in Stolmeus, Ecl. Phys. i p. 1026
αἷμα γὰρ ἀνθρώποις περικάρδιόν ἐστι
νόημα. But the two preceding lines
qualify this statement—-

αἵματος ἐν πελάγεσσι τεθραμμένη ἀντι-

θροῶντος

τῇ τε νόημα μάλιστα κυκλίσκεται ἀνθρώ-

ποισιν,
where τεθραμμένη refers to κραδίη.

Empedocles made the four elements
enter into the composition of the soul,
and held that we perceive each external
object by means of the corresponding
element in our soul: cf. γαίῃ μὲν γὰρ
γαῖαν ὀπώπαμεν ὕδατι δ’ ὕδωρ κ.τ.λ.,
quoted by Arist. de Anima i 2, 6; cf.
also Theophr. de Sens. 10 ὡσαύτως δὲ
λέγει (Ἐμπεδοκλῆς) καὶ περὶ φρονήσεως
καὶ ἀγνοίας· τὸ μὲν γὰρ φρονεῖν εἶναι τοῖς
ὁμοίοις, τὸ δὲ ἀγνοεῖν τοῖς ἀνομοίοις...διὸ
καὶ τῷ αἵματι μάλιστα. φρονεῖν, ἐν τούτῳ
γὰρ μάλιστα τῶν μερῶν κεκρᾶσθαι τὸ.
στοιχεῖα.

This and the remarks that follow shew
that it was because Emped. thought the
four elements to be best mixed at the
heart that he supposed that to be the seat
of thought, yet not exclusively its seat,
for he goes on to say that excellence in a
single department is due to the μέση
κρᾶσις being in a single part, orators sor
instance having it ἑν τῇ γλώττῃ, and
craftsmen ἐν ταῖς χερσί. In i 17, 41 Cic.
speaks more correctly‚ in Empedocleo
sanguine demersa.

alii in eorde: the Stoics held that the
dominant part of the soul, the ἡγεμονικόν,
had its seat in the heart, see Zeller, c. ix,
pp. 201—2; Diog. Laert. vii 159 ἡγεμο-
