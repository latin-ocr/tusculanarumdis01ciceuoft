who supplied him with an account of its readings, this MS very
plainly and clearly reads morte.

More recently I visited Wolfenbuttel and examined the three
less important MSS of the Tusculans contained in the Library
there, the best MS having been thoroughly collated already by
Seyffert. K'uhner's edition is one for which Ι have the highest
admiration. There is perhaps no work from which I have learned
more Latin. It was therefore surprising to me to find readings
constantly attributed by him to G 2 G ΙΙ or Aug. which are not
contained in those MSS. He even confuses G ΙΙ with Aug. in his
preliminary notice of these MSS. When a scholar so eminent
deals so inaccurately with the readings of MSS contained in a
town not fifty miles distant from his own, a new collation of MSS
seems desirable.

The fact is that no MS of the Tusculan Disputations has
been fully collated hitherto except Gudianus 294.

I have looked into upwards of eighty MSS and examined
several test passages with a view to ascertaining the value of
each. Thirty of these MSS I have carefully read through and
collated in detail.

All these thirty are in my opinion worth collating‚ in some
cases for their intrinsic merit, in others for their influence upon
the development of the printed text, in others for the light
which they throw upon the grouping of the MSS. Some of
these MSS have never been referred to in any edition up to the
present time. Amongst these are K E E 2 B 2 and J.

K is a first-class MS contained in the Bibliotheque Communale,
Cambrai. My attention having been drawn to it by the article of
DrRossbach, mentioned below, I collated it in the British Museum
to which it was lent for me by the courtesy of the French
Government.

E is a first-class MS contained in the British Museum (15 C XI).
It was formerly in the King’s Library and its collation had been
begun by Bentley, as shewn in my introduction. The first
published reference to this MS that I have seen occurs in
Philologus, Feb. 1904, vol. 63, p. 101 in an article by Dr Otto
Rossbach. Ι fully collated it two years ago in the Eritish
Museum and had my whole edition ready for the press when
this article appeared.

E 2 is a good second-class MS contained in the British
