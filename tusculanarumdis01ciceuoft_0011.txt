PREFACE.

LTHOUGH many excellent editions of the Tusculan Dis-

putations have been produced on the Continent within the

last hundred years yet, if we except Orelli’s Oxford edition of

1834 and a translation of Tischer and Sorof brought out by the

Rev. T. K. Arnold, not one has appeared* in the British Islands

since that of Davies, whose first edition was printed at Cam-
bridge in 1709.

The present edition of the Tusculan Disputations has grown
out of lectures delivered in Queen’s College, Belfast. Originally
intending the critical notes to be a very secondary portion of
my work, I had supposed that Ι could obtain the necessary
readings from existing editions, especially from those of Orelli,
K'uhner and Moser. Ι soon, however, became dissatisfied with
the apparatus criticus supplied by the works, otherwise excellent,
of these scholars. In the first place the inethod of citing readings
from the Oxford MSS (“dno Oxx„ quattuor ἀναν, 7 Oxx. eta-fl) no
particular Oxford MS except Ball. (and there are two Balliol MSS)
being separately indicated, proved very irritating. These MSS
were admitted not to be very valuable but they have been con-
sulted by scholars ever since the Renaissance and have therefore
had considerable influence upon the formation of the text. The
citations of Kuh. Mo. and Or. are derived from an edition
published at Oxford in 1783 containing readings from nine
Oxford MSS. Ihave not seen this edition but my collation of
the twelve MSS now in Oxford shews that the references made to
the Oxford MSS by the above-mentioned scholars are usually
very inaccurate, and the inaccuracy of the edition of 1783 is no
doubt the cause. Later on, being in Berne, I consulted the
Berne MS to see how the whole passage Ι §88 stands in it.
Ι was surprised to find that instead of reading carere in malo as
stated by Orelli on the authority of Usteri‚ a Berne Professor,
