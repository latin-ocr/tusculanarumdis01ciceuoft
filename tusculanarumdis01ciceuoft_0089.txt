merely the act of dying but the resulting
state.

Kiili.war1nly supports Bentley' 5 emend-
ation mors (wh. is also the reading by
correction, of the Vatican MS), tal 1n‹r
the corruption to have been caused by
the following miserum. But though mors
might be more strictly accurate Cic. may
not have expres-sed himself with perfect
accuracy here.

with ML, we must explain as Anon. in

bracket these words. Kiih. takes them
with what follows, putting the semi-colon
after haberemus. But though he finds in
the contrast to sempz'lernmn a special fit-
ness in the emphatic position thus secured
for the words it does not seem natural.

calcem· a straight line drawn with
chalk or pipe- c-lay across the floor of the
circus to mark the finishing point; de-
cursum continues the metaphor from the
tace-course.

Epicharmus was born at Cos but
brought to Sicily when young or went
there at a later date.

ut Siculi: lit. ‘ as being a Sicilian ³ 3 ut
(cf. Gk ὡς) does not imply anything as
to whether the Sicilians were witty or
not. They were, as a matter of fact,
reputed witty, cf. Verr. iv 43, 95 ‘ num·

quam tam male est Siculis quin aliquid
facete et commode dicant'; also Brut.
12, 46. Here therefore the meaning is
‘witty, as a Sicilian might be expected
to be‚' cf. 43, 104 ⁸ DiogeneS, ut Cynicus,
proici se iussit inhumatum.' It is equally
common for ut to receive from the con-
text a restrictive soree, cf. Cato Μ. 4, 12
‘multae etiam, ut in homine Romano.
litterae.' Cf. ὡς in Thuc. iv 84, 2 ἣν δὲ
οὐδὲ ἀδύνατος, ὡς Λακεδαιμόνιος, εἰπεῖν.

scis enlm: i.e. Cic. translates the ex-
tracts from Greek writers and avoids
soisting in any Greek, the more so as
his philosophical works are intended sor
readers assumed to be little acquainted
with Greek literature. In writing to
Atticus, his purpose being different, he
introduces Greek freely.

emori... : trochaic tetrameter catalec-
tic. H. Sauppe conjectures the Greek
to have been ἀποθανεῖν οὐχ ἁνδάνει μοι·
τεθνάναι δ’ οὐ διαφέρει. The accus. of price
(m‘lzz‘l) with aestimo perhaps occurs only
here. Ml. and Schiche may be right in
altering to πιΙιίίί.

adgnoscoz‘ iam ex uerbis illis Latinis
adgnosco uerba Graeea’ 3 cf. ii 11, 26
‘non enim adgnosco)

coegisti ut concederem: the infin. is
more usual with cogo in Cic. but cf. ἓ 16
below and p. Mil. 26, 71 ; Ac. ii 3, 8;
Or. iii ο.
