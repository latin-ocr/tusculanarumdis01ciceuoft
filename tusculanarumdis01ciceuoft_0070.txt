quia philosophia Graecis et litteris et doctoribus percipi non

cally a restatement of remissa temporibus
acc. to Cic’ s frequent custom which has
led so often to the unnecessary assumption
of glosses. ]

pertinerent.. contineretur: we might
have expected p ertzneant and contineatur
(subj. due to cum causal). continentur
takes its time srorn putaui (cf. Madv.
ξ 383) and brings inp rtinerent by attrac-
tion. For attraction of tense and mood
see Draeger, Hi-sl Sym Ιξ 153, especially
subsec. 4.

Kuh„ here and in Gram. 11 ξ 181,
p. 778, notes thatin subordinate clauses,
even though, as here, the reflection may
be general, a preceding perfect 1s usually
followed by a secondary sequence. Cf.
4, 7 ‘iudicaui.. .posset'

ratio 81. disciplina‚‘ systematie me-
thod.' Ktih„ on 4. 12, explains that in
ἓν διὰ δυοῖν os this kind one of the two
substantives does the work osan adjective
which the language lacks; cf. iii 1, 2
⁴ rationem et doctrinam.' Cf. also Naegels-
bach, Stil. 73. τ’..

studio...quae philosophia dicitur: for
this attraction of the rel. to the gender
of the following substantive see Madv.
ἓ 16.

3quae philosophia dicitur: sor the
indicative in an explanatory clause, which
may be omitted without prejudice to the
leading idea, see Madv. ἓ 369. These
words (lo not form part of the thought
which he had at the time referred to.
FAW. thinks that the explanatory clause
indicates that the word philosophia had
not yet been established in common use
when Cic. wrote this passage.

[philosophia: this passage does not,
I think,
usual.
Plaut. and later writers have philosophus,
Enn. philosophari (also sophia). Plin.
xiii ξ 84 shews that the word was in one
of the oldest annalists (Cassius Hemina).
Here Cic. only means to put forward
studium sapientiae as a very clear Latin
representation of φιλοσοφία. Cf. Leg.

shew that philosophia was un-
It could hardly so be, when

i ἓ 58 ‘cuius (sapientiae) amore Graeco
uerbo philosophia nomen inuenit’; see
also Off. ii ξ 5. The word sapientius is
used with definite point be10w=4>t>xow
φικώτερον.]

contineretur with the simple abl.=
‘depends upon’3 cf. Wilkins on Or.
i 2, 8.

non quia. .non posset: subj. of re-
ported r;eason the reason that another
gives, or might give, rejected. Kiih.
notes that non q1‹0‚710n quadis more
usual in Cicero.

litteris 813 doctoribus: ablatives of
means: doctoribus would scarcely have
been placed in this construction if litteris
had not preceded.

non quia...sed...fuit: usually sed quod
(sed quia) follows in a dependent clause,
cf. Madv. ξ 3571). For the transition to
a main clause cf. ii 26, 64; iii 22, 54.

[meum semper iud.: in this colloca-
tion semper has almost the force of an
adj.]

[iud. fuit with constr. of iudicare]

omnia.. sapientius quam Graecos: for
this exaggerated estimate of the intel-
lectual powers of his countrymen cf. Or.
i 4‚15¹ingenia uero, ut multis rebus
possumus iudicare, nostrorum hominum
multum ceteris hominibus omnium gen-
tium praestiterunt.' For its cause cf.
Kiih.: ‘Hanc Cic. sententiam nimio
patriae amore obcaecatus et fortasse eo
consilio uidetur protulisse, ut Romano-
rum animos ad litterarum studium perse-
quendum exhortaretur.’

quae quidem...statusssent: the subj.
is in or. obl.‚ but even in direct dis-
course the verb with the rel. introducing
a limitation would here be in the sub-
junctive, since the reference is 10 a
class and not to particular instances.
Cf. Roby ἓξ 1692,
obs. 2.

elaborarent: subj. of purpose, Madv.
