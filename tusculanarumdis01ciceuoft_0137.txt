fused that we have here no doubt a 6356
of haplography.

motus principium: Plato’s words are
οὕτω δὴ κινήσεως μὲν ἀρχὴ τὸ αὐτὸ αὑτὸ
κινοῦν, ‘the source of motion is a thing
which is self-moving.’ Cic. expresses the
same meaning by ‘motion originates from
a thing which is sels-moving.’ principium
here is used in the abstract sense of ‘com-

For

mencement,' while in the previous lines,

it has been several times used in the
concrete sense of ‘initial cause) The
seeming contradiction between this line
and prinsipe'z' mella est ongo has led Hei.
to give the words ex co sit qnod a meaning
(‘belongs to the class of that which‘) for
which it would be hard to find parallels.
The instance wh. he quotes from Off. i 30,
107 does not bear that interpretation.

uel concidat omne caelum omnisque
natura consistat necesse est: this, the
reading of the MSS, has given rise to
many attempts at emendation. Plato
has ἦ πάντα. τε οὐρανὸν πᾶσάν τε ’γένεσιν
συμπεσοῦσαν στῆναι καὶ μήποτε αὖθις ἔχειν
ὅθεν κινηθέντα γενήσεται. TS. and Hei.
retain the MS reading. The meaning then
is ‘or else the whole universe 1111151 111-
evitably sink in ruin and all creation
(:created things) corne to a standstill.’
This gives very good sense although it is
slightly different from the words of Plato,
who makes the whole universe and all
creation both sink in ruin and come to 3
standstill. For caelum in this sense cf.

οὐρανός 1 4. Some editors have stumbled
over nel. If we had here a disjunctive
proposition co-ordinated with a preceding
negative proposition we should expect
ant and not nel. But the clause, just as
the ἤ clause in the corresponding Greek,
is loosely tacked on (cf. Madv. Gla Synt.
R. Ι App. ξ 283.) For aut and uel see
Draeger ΙΙ ἐξ 343, 344. The conjecture
terra sor natura, approved by Bentley
(‘recte Lambinus aliique ex Platone ipso
omnisque lerra'), was disposed of when
Bekker restored ’γένεσιν 111 Plato, with
the best MSS, for -γῆν, Ι11 order to bring
Cic. into more exact correspondence with
Plato, K'uh. aster Or. inserts ac between
natura and consz'slat on Mahly's con—
jecture. But Reid, on Ac. ii 11, 34, has
Shewn that ac, where it occurs in MSS of
Cicero before a gutturaL is to be viewed
with so much suspicion that a conjecture
which inserts ac before a guttural can
scarcely be accepted. Schiche follows
Ml. who, relying on the MSS of Rep. vi
25, 27 and Macrobius, inserts et. The
conjectures of Sff., ut non for uel and sit
for est (after necesse), seem unnecessary if
uel be taken as above suggested3 other-
wise the construction given by him is no
doubt correct, and the three changes in-
volved are changes which often, separately,
occur.

qua a. primo: most MSS qua primo,
but several MSS of Somnium Scipionis
(Macrobius) give a. Similarly in ii 1, 4
‘auxilia a‚’ iv 21, 47 ‘auersa 3 ratione‚'
v 25, 70 ‘illa a deo' good MSS omit a
after final a.
