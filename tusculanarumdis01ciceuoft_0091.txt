non efficias, quod uis, tamen, mors ut malum non sit, efficies.
sed nihil te interpellabo; continentem orationem audire malo.
17. M. Quid? si te rogauero aliquid, nonne respondebis?
Α. Superbum id quidem est, sed, nisi quid necesse erit,

malo non roges.

Μ’. Geram tibi morem et ea, quae uis, ut potero,

explicabo, nec tamen quasi Pythius Apollo, certa ut sint et
fixa, quae dixero, sed ut homunculus unus e multis probabilia

to be distinguished from this. 'she
negative of this ut is ut non, cf. Madv.

efficies ut : with subj. Cic. uses efficia,
both active and passive, with nt and suhj.
and with acc. and infin.‚ in the sense of
probare active and sequi passive. For the
former cf. 31 ἓ 76 and for the latter v 25,

uiuendum sit se ipsa contenta.'

ξ 17. nonne respondebis: Kiih. reads
non, thinking it scarcely credible ‘that
copyists could change the “uulgare ’⁸
nonne into the “rarius et exquisitius”
non, while the change of the less familiar
non into nonne was easy.' And non may
be right, but if so 1 take nonne to have
arisen from the misunderstanding of 311
abbreviation and not by the process
assumed by Krih„ and as it seems at
least equally possible that non has got
into a few MSS through an abbrevia-
tion being misread 1 follow the reading
of the best MSS. For non)(nonne see
Madv. on Fin. ii 3, 103 Kritz, Sall.
Iug. 31, p. 185.

superbum id quidem est: sc. non
respondere roganti, cf. Ac. ii 22, 94 ‘si
habes quod liqueat neque respondes, su-
perbe.’ [superbumz Roman feeling on
this point was curiously strong. In ad-
dition to the passages in my 11. 011 Acad.
ii 94, cf. August. Ep. 118, 2 ‘si 111-
terrogatus quis 11011 responderit, indoctus
et hebes putabitur.⁷ A similar passage
in Arnob. c. g. ii 1. Also a jest much
misunderstood by commentators on Att.
iv 18, 3 (16, 11). That the arrogantia
attributed to Tiberius was due to persistent
silence when addressed is shewn by the
also Theophr. of the αὐθάδης...ἑστὶν οἶος
προσαγορευθεὶς μὴ ἀντιπροσειπεῖν.]

celeri quos quidem inspexi malo non roges.

malo non roges z as ne not non is used
after verbs of wishing (Madv, ἓ 456), on
account of the implied prohibition, some
editors (Or. Mo.) have altered to nc.
Ktih. explains non rages as opposed to
the preceding si te rogauero and = abstineas
rogamlot cf. certain uses of οὑ φάναι 111
Greek and other instances of οὑ 10 be
accounted for on this principle, where
μὴ might be expected. [malo non: but
cf. Fin.:i 26, ‘uellem ne deterruisset';
Phil. 8, 31 ; and there are other exx.]

IX. quasi Pythius Apollo ι i.e. with
authority, ὡς ἐκ τρίποδος.

homunculus unus e multis: cf. Hor.
Sat. i 9, 71 ‘sum paulo infirmior, unus
multorum '; Cic. Brut. 79, 274 ‘non fuit
orator unus e multis, potius inter multos
prope singularis fuit'3 Plin. Ep. i 3, 1
⁶ quid agit Cornum ?...quid illa porticus?...
possidentne te ?...si possident, felix bea-
tusque es: sin minus, unus ex multis.’
¹ An ordinary individual,’ a single indi·
vidua] among many similar. This use is
not different in kind from the use of unus
with superlatives and words denoting emi-
nence, where it seems to have an intensive
force, as in ii 26, 64 ‘unam omnium rem
pulcherrimam'; ii 18, 43 ‘ quae una ce-
teris excellebat’; nor is it different from
its use in passages where it seems to have
a disparaging force, as in Catullus 22, 8
‘unus caprimulgus.' For a unit among
goat-herds is a humble unit, while a
unit among superlatives is an exalted
unit, and (as in our passage and in Or. i
29, 132 ⁴ unus paterfamilias’) a unit
among a multitude is an ordinary unit.
Again, where men (asin i 12, ²7 ‘unum
illud erat insitum priscis illis ³) have only
one idea they are apt to have that idea
firnily fixed.
