MSS one can scarcely change aczgrnoscere
to cognoscere. If interpolation were more
common in the best MSS one might suspect
that the true cognoscere had been early
altered to adgnoscere owing to aasgnoscz't
(correctly used) three lines lower down.
Reading adgnoscere it must be taken as
in N.D. i 19, 49 ‘haec et inuenta sunt
acutius et dicta subtilius ab Epicuro,
quam ut quiuis ea posset adgnoscere‚’
where Mayor translates ‘to feel their
force.’

ex quo tollitur: because the ideas are
few as compared with the phenomena of
sense.

neque: v 5, 12 ‘non dubito nec id
nunc agitur.’ We should say ‘and yet...
n0t⁷ but in Lat. the antithesis is left un-
expressed; cf. 29, 71 n. on adhibuitque.

plane uidet: inserted to meet a possible
objection that, if Plato’s theory were cor-
rect, the 50111 ought to have all the clearer
recollection the shorter the time in which
it is enclosed within the body. Cf.
Timaeus p. 44. Hei.

adgnoscit: here in the usual sense of
the word as explained by Ktih. above,
cf. 8, 15 ‘iam adgnosco Graecum,’ and
often.

partment of νηευιονίαεμνήμη Cic. now

sense of the term and introduces it as
something more wonderful than ἀνάμνησις,

meaning of Plato's argument from ἀνά.-
μνησις. [There is some reason to suspect
maiore etiam quodam modo. You can
say tali quodam modo, or alio (J.m.,
because tali modo and alio m. can stand.
But maiore modo sor maiorem in modam
is not possible]

quo meminimus: a necessary corr. for
quod of the best MSS, cf. 34, 82 and 34,
83 11.

naturam: I retain naturam with the
MSS, but strongly suspect that natam is
the true reading and that the word was
early mistaken sor an abbreviation of
naturam. XVhen linked together natura
‘essence’ and uis ‘inherent character’ are
almost synonyms; and though they may
very well be linked together by alque (as
in 23, 54) theycan scarcely be distinguished
by aut. Cf. Bent. apud Dav. In aut
mule natam the suggestion would be that
the 50111 came from a divine source and
so was immortal (on the principle illus-
trated from Lactantius iii 18 in Exc. ΙΙ).
The same meaning might be obtained
from aut unde natm-am,but not so naturally
expressed and not so much 111 harmony
with Stoic or Platonic theory. [The
point about aut is not quite conclusive.
Idioms occur with aut where we should
naturally expect et; e-g. (to take the first
example to hand) Plaut. Pseud. 963 ‘quis
hic homo chlamudatus est? aut undest?'
where the idea is ‘I might ask the one
question or the other’; so here ‘I might
put it this way or that.’]
