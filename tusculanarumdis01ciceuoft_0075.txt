Graecia musici floruerunt, discebantque id omnes, nec, qui
nesciebat, satis excultus doctrina putabatur. 5. in summo

Turs. 1 370 foll. [The principal support
for annas lies in the construction ofablzinc
with anuos, probably the only Ciceronian
constr. with abhinc]

aliquot: as usual=a good number,
‘many years earlier’3 Themistocles
flourished more than 100 years earlier
than Epaminondas (Salamis 480 B.C.,
Leuctra 371 B.C.). Cf. ii 27, 66 n. ali-
quanto.

cum recusaret...est habitus: Ktih„
against Ern. and FAW. who thought
the plup. required, holds that the imperf.
is correct where the time referred to in
the subord. (cum) clause is contempora-
neous with that referred to in the main
clause, comparing 35, 86; ii 25, 60;
v 37, 108. But those passages do not
seem parallel and we should certainly
have expected the pluperfect here if some
definite occasion is referred to. V has
rerusaset corrected mann secunda to
recusasset. But Dr Reid in a note to me
suggests that the imperf. recusaret may
indicate that it was his custom. As this
view gives a natural force to the word it
is better to retain the received reading.

The reason for the mood is the same as
in cum essem 1, 1 n.

ergo, ‘hence‚' i.e. owing to the high
importance attached to music.

floruerunt, discebant: Ktih. Gr.11§ 33,
8 n. 2 p. 100 points out that the perf. does
not differ from the imperf. as momentary
from continuous‚ but that an event of
very brief duration is expressed by the
imperf. where the action is represented
in its prognen, while an event even of
very long duration is expressed by the

further observes that the perf. is con-
sequently suitable for the expression os
the main sad, the imperf. for the ex-
pression of accompanying circumstances
osan explanatory or descriptive char-
acter. Cf. 30, 72 ‘censebat...disseruit.'

discebantque: que introduces details,
cf. note on iacentque, above.

id: musica implied in musici, cf. ii 27,
66 n. in eo persequendo.

§5. mathematicis: e.g. Pythagoras
and Plato.

metiendi...modum z ‘but we have
restricted this science to the practical
purposes of mensuration and calcula-
tion.’

ΙΙΙ. oratorem: metonymy, :eloquen-
tiam3 but the orator whom we encouraged
is contrasted with the poet, painter, etc.‚
whom we did not encourage. More—
over, Latin tends to bring the person into
prommence.

eruditum: in the same sense as doclos
below, trained in the theory of the art
(by Greek teachers and on Greek models)
as contrasted with aptum ad dicendum,
possessing a natural aptitude for speaking.
Similarly Roman poets, especially those
who followed Alexandrine models, were
called docti, cf. Hor. Sat. i 9, 7 ‘noris
nos, docti sumus.' See 1, 3 n.

Galbam : Seruius Sulpicius Galba,
consul 144 ΒΕ. For his importance in
the history of Roman oratory and for the
technical resources of which he was the
first Roman to make use cf. Brut. 31,
82 ; for the characteristics of Laelius and
Africanus ibid. ἓ 83.
