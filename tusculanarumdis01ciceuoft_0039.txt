ltalia exaratas. Graecis lacis uacuam spatium relictmn cst.'' Quoted by
Or. Mo. and Kiih. as Aug. Contains T. D. only. This MS does not
end at the end of 6. 21 131< v as Kiih. asserts. He 6011111565 11 with
G 3 (his Gud. 11), which seems to end there. See above.

Gr. This ms was used by J. xl. Brutus for the Tusculans in his
edition of all Cicero published in 1570 in 9 vols. hy Antonius Gryphius
at Lyons. There is a copy os this edition in the Imperial Library at
Vienna, 45 Aa 36. I know of no other which is complete. The
Tusculans are in vol. 1. I have taken the readings of Gr from this
edition. Some volumes are in the University Library at Leyden but
vol. 1 is missing. The MS is probably lost. It is not known to be
identical with any existing MS. The data given by Brutus seem scarcely
sufficient to enable us to decide positively whether such identification is
possible or not.
