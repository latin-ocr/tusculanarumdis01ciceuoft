earlier applications before it was referred
to musical sounds: cf. L. and Scott s.v.
ἁρμονία. Aristoxenus, as a musician,
applied it to the soul in its musical accept-
ance, but only by metaphor; cf. 10, 20 n.
and see Reid on Ac. ii 39, 1²4· Strietly
by harmonia (ἁρμονία) the ancients under-
stood, not what we term lzarmmiy, but
melody. VVhether the ancients had any
knowledge of harmouy is a question that
has been much discussed. They sang
or played unisons. Men and boys sang
together, the boys an octave higher than
the men, Arist. Probl. xxxix 19. They
also played successions of concords on
the μάγαδις, ‘a treble instrument with
double strings tuned octaves to each
other, like the octave stop in our harpsi-
chord.' Cf. Burney‚ History os Music, 1
p. 132, who quotes Arist. l'robl. xix ἓ 8
διὰ τί ὴ διὰ πασῶν συμφωνία ᾅδεται μόνη·
μαγαδίζουσι ’γοῦν ταύτην· ἄλλην δὲ οὐδε-
μίαν. See also HelmholtZ, Sensatz'ons of
Tene, trans. by Ellis, pt iii c. xiii, sect.
on homophonic music (p. 237 of znd
edn), ‘That music in the time of highest
Grecian culture, neglecting perhaps in-
dividual instrumental ornamentation, ca-
demes, and interludes, was written in
one part, or that the voices at most sang
in octaves, can now be considered as
established.’

ex interuallis sonorum: i.e. from the
distance (in pz'tclz) between sounds; cf.

quorum uaria compositio: ‘and the
varied arrangement (the συστήματα os the
Philebus, above) of these musical notes
<according to scale) also gives us several
melodies' (harmonias i.e. airs or tunes).

soul, according to Democritus, is that
which effects the movement of living
beings. It must therefore consist of the
most movable substance—offine, smooth,
and round aloms—in other words of fire. . . .
