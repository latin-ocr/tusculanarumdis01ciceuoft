ss EXCURSUS 11.

NOTE ΟΝ i 24, 56 foll.

Cicero, in this chapter, does not express himself clearly. In Cato M. 21, 78 he
successively sets forth two arguments for the immortality of the soul: (α) 1116 50111 15
1101 composite and therefore cannot be broken up and perish (for this argument
cf. also T.D. i 29, 71); (h) the power of ἀνάμνησις 15 3 proof that the 50111 existed before
entering the body, and therefore that it will exist after it quits the body. In N. D. ii
12, 33 Cicero works out, as a proof of the divine existence, 3 third argument. The
argument there is as follows: there is a gradual 3566111 from vegetable life to animal
life, from animal life to human life; the last mentioned being distinguished by the
possession of ralia, but not ratio recta constansque. But, as all things strive after
perfection and as universal nature can attain to perfection, there is a divine being
who possesses ratio recta caussamque. Cf. Sext. Empir. adu. Math. ix 88.

Cic. seems to commence the chapter with the first argument before his mind: he
could understand how sangnis, bilis etc. are compounded (and therefore how they may
be broken up); but with regard to the 50111 116 5661115 about to say that he fails to see
how it, being simplex, could be broken up, when suddenly he thinks of Plato's ψυχή
ἄλογος and 50 drifts into the argument from the Scale of Existence‚ the third referred
to above.

For this argument see especially a very complete note in Mayor on N. D. ii 12, 33.
According to the Stoics all things in nature are divided into four classes: the class os
inorganic objects, held together by ψιλὴ ἕξις, ‘the unifying principle in organic nature’
(Mayor), e.g. λίθοι καὶ ξύλα; 1116 61355 of plants‚ held together by φύσις, 1116 principle of
growth (natura in our passage); the class of the lower animals, held together by 3
50111 (irrational); and the class of rational beings. Cf. Sext. Emp. adu. Math. ix 81
quoted by Zeller, Stoics, etc. p. 196. The history of this argument is well traced by
Mayor.

This argument, which in N.D. ii 12, 33 was employed to prove the divine existence,
is also available to prove the immortality of the soul, for the 50111 of man is akin to
the 50111 of the universe, which is the Deity. This view 15 Aristotelian, see Zeller 112
p. 359 and n. 5. For a similar application of 3 1110οῐ of the divine existence to prove
the immortality of the 50111 cf. T. D. i 13, 30 init.

Since the argument from the Scale of Existence depends upon the pre-eminence of
the mental powers possessed by man, Cic. further drifts from it into 3 fourth argu-
ment, viz. that powers so pre-eminent must belong to something immortal. This
argument is also found in the passage in Cato M. 21, 78 sic sentio cum tanta celeritas
animm-um sit, lanta memoria praelerilorum suturm‘mnque prudentia, lot ezr-les, lamae
scientiae, tot inuenta, mm posse eam naturam quae res eas contineat esse mortalem.
Note that in our passage the words habel primum memoriam imply that the mention
of other saculties is to follow. These follow in 25, 61 quid? illa m's. In considering
Cicero’s treatment of these arguments it is to be borne in mind that Cic. does not
write this book in order to prove the immortality os the soul. His position is that
(a) if the 50111 15 immortal death is 10 116 (1651115611, 311(1 there 316 arguments forits
immortality, (b) even if the soul perishes there is no evil in death, cf. i 33, 81. And
it must be admitted that Cic. does not state any of his arguments sor the immortality of
the 50111 with much force of conviction.

The argument based upon the fact that the soul is simplex was the less convincing
