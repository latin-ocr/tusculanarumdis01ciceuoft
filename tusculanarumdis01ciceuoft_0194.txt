praecordiis: ‘circa praecordia potis-
simum, ait Beroaldus, grassari solet uis
ueneni. Horatius (Epod. iii 5) quid hoc
ueneni saeuit in praecordiisP’ Mo. But
the word is often used simply of the
stomach, cf. Fin. v 30, 92 ‘anulus in
praecordiis piscis inuentus· est.'

praebiberat z propinaaerat. This,
the true reading, uas restored by J Μ.
Brutus from Gr. (3 R E and some in-
ferior MSS also read praebiberat, with qui
instead of sai. praebuerat of inferior
MSS and most early editions could not be
said of Critias, who did not personally
administer the poison. praebiberat occurs
nowhere else in Cic„ and only here in
classical Latin. Davies quotes the word
from Apuleius, Metamorph. x p. 334;
and from two places in St Jerome, and
Bentley quotes from ⁴ Glossarium Graeco-
Latinum' (1.6. from Stephanus⁷ Thesau-
rus) ιΠροπίνω propino, p1·obibo,’and adds
‘ corrige praebibo.³

consecuta est ε 16, 36 n.

Theramenes was put to death 111 the
latter half of 404 B.C.; Critias fell early
in 403.

§9⁹7. quis hanc...si...iudicaret: Ca-
merarius rightly objected to this reason-
ing—-‘ Immo uero quis laudaret magno
opere illam animi aequitatem, si mortem
bonum iudicaret? Nam uirtus elucescit 1n
aduersis grauibus calamitosisque casibus,
non spectatur rebus prospens et in molli
uita.’

animi aequitatem: aequanzmz'tatem, a
word which occurs in Terence, Ph. prol.
343 Ad. pr.ol 24.

uadit: for narie te of striding mansully
into danger see Dict. The reading may
be sound; in that case we have zeugma

many conjectures3 Hei. reads petatque

is that in has a final use here with
scyphum. Soc. boldly enters the same

Dr Reid in an article in Hermathena,
vol. XI, nO. 27, pp. 251—2, which I had
not noticed until these notes were ready
sor the press‚ defends the construction
thus :—

‘That uadit in scyphum would never,
by itself, have been written by Cicero
is certain; the question whether it comes
within the proper limits of zeugma has
been disputed. To me it seems a sim-
pler example of zeugma than many
which have been retained in our texts
without debate. The expression uadit
in [cn-[erem recalls ire in eculeum (Tuse.
v§ 14): Socrates advances to meet the
terror of the prison and the poison-cup
as of 6116111165 10 whom his spirit will not
yield.'

uadit in eundem: R V G B with
many inferior Mss read uadit enim in.
Dav. Mo. Sff. Hei. TS. reject enim.
Kuh. retains and seeks to justify it by
supplying in thought at mars malum non
est iudicanda. It seems best-to follow
Sff. who supposes that we have a case
of dittografflzia, a copyist having first
written enim (·N·) by mistake sor IN,
and then adding IN on finding that word
