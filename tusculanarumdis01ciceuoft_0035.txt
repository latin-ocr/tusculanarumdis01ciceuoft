INTROJJUCTJON xxxi

probably spring from the same archetype as V²‚ seems to me to be sully
borne out by the readings that Ι have recorded from those mss that
1 have placed in group β.

The MS originally consisted of 97 leaves os parchment. A portion
of the end of Book v, which had suffered damage, was subsequently re-
copied on two more leaves, The original copyist had added at the end
M. Tulli Ciceronis Jicscnlanrmn (sic) liber V explic-n feliciter, and below
this another hand had written Conlnlsmns (Stroebel, p. 49).

A note on a ily-leaf at the beginning shews that the ms is one of
those presented to the Vatican Library by Fulvio Orsini (in 1600 A.1).),
and that it had earlier belonged to the famous humanist Antonio Becca-
delli, known as Panormita (1394—1471 A.11).).

This ius rivals R and G in excellence. In the following places it is
right where the best MSS are wrong :

1 4 grecie, with others, 1 42 uidetur, with many others, 1 88 ne
carere quidem 3 1 95 ponamus, without iussn tyrannorum 3 11 31 debilitari
dolore3 11 39 ecfilri V Β alone; et fari E.

11 48 ac ad custodia is read by V¹ and E alone (this being the
nearest to what seems the right reading). In 11 62 contemndo seems
nearer the true reading, and a inore faithful attempt to copy the true
reading than contempno of R¹ G P¹. See Introd. p. xlviii.

V was copied from an excellent source, but that source was very
closely related to the sources of all the best existing mss. It has been
corrected, very soon after it was written, by another hand, and the
corrections, which are obviously right in a remarkably large number
of instances, derive special value from the fact that their source was
only very remotely related to the sources of the best known MSS.

V² alone has the right reading in :—1 5 carb0nmn3 1 7 scientia, 1 20
parere, and perhaps ei preceding, 1 81 dz'ssinn'lztndines 3 1 98 indicio
z'm'quo circumuentos, 1 1 10 e boeotia, 1 1 16 qni item oraculo, 11 2 sinon

aspernatam 1 116 alclmlamas (lc should be absent, but no other MS has
the correct termination).

Vg has the right reading in 1 3 quingentis, with K O 9 alone 3 1 20
ullum nnmerum, with O 52 alone ; 1 73 ratis, with O 9 10 alone ; 1 97 cni

V² is right along with others and against the best Mss in 1 24
