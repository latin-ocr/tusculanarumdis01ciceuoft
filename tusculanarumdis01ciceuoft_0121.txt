a grauioribus, ἥττω] ᾔτηη] For the
Stoic view, derived from Aristone, 366
Zeller‚ Stoics, cla, pp. 15779· Aristotle
held that there were two original kinds
of motion, (a) circular or ὴ περὶ τὸ μέσον,
(b) rectilinear or ἡ ἄνω καὶ κάτω, i.e. cen-
trifugal and centripetal. aether is in
eternal circular motion; of the four
elements earth is heavy‚ fire light, air
heavy relatively to fire, light relatively to
water; water heavy relatively to air, light
relatively to earth. Fire and air are
centrisugal, water and earth are centri-
petal. For the. view of Aristotle cf. De
Caelo ii 3 quoted in R. and P. ἓ 332.
See also Grote's Aristotle p. 631 col. 2
and Zeller, Phil. cler Grieclzen ΙΙ2 pp. 435
—446. The same view passed down to
the Stoics and is assailed by Luer. i
1083 sqq, where see Munro.

animos...corpore: for the change from
plur. to sing. (or uice uersa) cf. 30, 72
‘animorum e corpore excedentium⁷; ii
23, 54 ‘corporibus...animus' (where see
Kiihner's note). So often.

animales, ‘gaseous.¹

spirabiles: cf. N.D. ii 36, 91 ‘terra
circumfusa undique est hac animali...
spirabilique natura, cui nomen est aer.⁷

siue animales.. s.iue ignei: and if the
soul belongs to any one of the four
elements it must be ammalis οι· lgneus,
for these two elements were active and
the seats of all active soree, while earth
and water were passive. Zeller, l.c. p.
189. See also Ac. i 6, 24, and Reid’s n.

sublime: there is no need to read in
sublime with inferior MSS. sublime is
used by Cic. in this sense, cf. ii 10, 24
‘sublime auolans'; and also as an adverb
of rest 43, 102 humine an sublime
putescat'3 Diu. ii 31, 67 ‘scuta quae
fuerant sublime fixa'3 N. D. ii 39, 101

‘.aer. sublime fe1·.’tur

ἕ 41. numerus: cf. 10, το n.

58) is pretty certainly right in altering to
est, which Hei. Sff. ΤΒ. Ml. Schiche
adopt. Either Cic. wrote csl and below
sunl or he changed the construction as
the sentence proceeded. Ktih. endeavours
to support sit as expressing the view of
others as opposed to Cicero's own, but
this is not a recognised use of si with the
subjunctive. No passa‹re of those cited
from Cicero by 1)raeger,stl.Sytzl. 11

Draeger does not seem to have the best
reading in the extract from Cat. i 13, 31
where wilkins reads εἰ biberunt ‘with
Madv. and the best MSS, for si biberint
of inferior MSS) (d) In Fin. iii 11, 38
‘quis...non ipsa turpitudine, etiam si
eum laesura non sit, offenditur,⁷ the
meaning is ‘Who is not offended by what
is base (general principle) even though it
would not injure him' (particular hypo-
thetical instance) i.e. ‘even in the case
where it would not injure him.' If we
had the subj. in both clauses the mean-
ing would be ⁴ who would not be offended
by baseness even though it would not
injure him.’

quod subtiliter magis quam dilucide
dicitur, ‘a statement more superficial
than clear.' From the original meaning
of ‘finely woven' we have (inter alia)
the metaphorical sense of ‘refined‚⁷ hence
‘slzglzt‚' not deep, and also the sense of
‘over-refined.’ The latter scarcely suits
here. For a good note on subtilis see
Sandys on Or. 5, 20. The sorm of
expression seems here suggested by the
sact that the g nus l nne in oratory (sub-
tile) was also⁸⁵ a clear style, ef. Or. 5, 20.
