of the soul's atonis, there is danger lest
they should be forced out of the body by
the air that surrounds us. Against this
danger we are protected by our inspira-
tion, the importanee of which lies in its
constantly introducing new fiery and vital
matter into the body (cf. spirabilem here).
Zeller, Fra-Soc. Phil. ΙΙ pp. 257 sqq.
See also Arist. De Anima i 2 quoted
there.

§40 we have ‘animales, id est spirabiles-³

Perhaps poltsszmzcm may indicate that
the view was more cleuly and fully set
forth by Panaetius

Panaetius of Rhodes, flor. about
150 B.C. He succeeded Antipater of
Tarsus as head of the Stoic school. For
his attitude towards Stoic doctrines and
style see Fin. 1ν, 28, 79. His most im-
portant work was ΙΙερι του Καθήκοντος

rived 1115 11131011315 sor the first two books
