Q'43. The utterances of Epicurus are unsatisfactory. We must go to
those schools in which the honourable is held to be the chief good and
the base the chief evil. Q'Q 44—5.

If you hold this view you must control yourself: your reason must
control your lower nature, QQ 47—8.

This lower nature may require extreme coercion and the calling in
of external assistance-—cf. uinciatur, etc. (This seems metaphorical: if
your own force of will does not avail, regard for your friends’ opinion—
cf. fi‘aclos pudore—must assist) Q 48. Or in a less extreme case it may
only require firm control (cf. ut imperator 7222'l2‘t2'); an illustration from
Pacuvius, QQ 49, 50. But 111 1110 case of the perfect philosopher the
lower nature obeys the higher as readily as a good child obeys a' just
parent, Q 51. This self-control is brought about by resolution, firmness,
and self-examination‚ Q 51. Think of noble examples: eg. those of
Zeno of Elea; Anaxarchus the Democritean3 Calanus, C. Marius,
§s 52‘3·

This exercise of sels-control and bracing up of one’s resolution not
only brings the lower nature into subjection, but actually makes pain
lighter‚ QQ' 53-—4. Think of the disgrace of crying out under pain,
‚Q'Q‘ 55—7. Think how noble it is to endure pain calmly, Q 58. This
thought inspires heroes in battle, Q 593 and philosophers, eg. Posidonius,
Q 61 (Dionysius of Heraclea was an apostate, Q60); and all who endure
hardships for the sake of glory, QQ 62, 63. But the verdict of one's own
conscience affords a higher and truer testimony, Q 64. This endurance
of pain, since it must proceed from fixed philosophie principles, must
be uniform and invariable, Q 65.

Pain, then, is either not an evil or, if it be an evil, it is an evil
so slight that virtue, i.e. fortitude, reduces it to insignificance, especially
as death is always available as a release, QQ 66, 67.
