The Epicureans placed the rational

η part of the soul in the breast, its irrational

’ ,. part being diffused over the whole body.

Zeller, c. xvii, p. 430; Diog. Laert. x 66
καὶ τὸ μέντοι ἄλογον αὐτῆς ἐν τῷ λοιπῷ
παρεσπάρθαι σώματι, τὸ δὲ λογικὸν ἐν τῷ
θώρακι, ὡς δῆλον ἔκ τε τῶν φόβων καὶ τῆς
χαρας.

alii in cerebro: the Pythagoream. Cf.
Philolaus in R. and P. ξ 70. Plato in
his triple division of the soul (Republic,
Timaeus) placed the rational soul in the
head. Of the two divisions of the irra-
tional soul he placed the θυμοειδές 111 the
breast and the ἐπιθυμητικόν between the
diaphragm and the umbilicus, Timaeus
69 c—70 d. It is disputed whether Plato
held both τὸ λογιστικόν and τὸ ἄλο-γον to
be immortal, or only the former.

animam=‹1erz,a common meaning of
the word. Anaximenes held this view3
cf. llut. de Plac. Ph. 1, 3 ἐκ -γὰρ τοιτου
τὰ πάντα ’γίγνεσθαι καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν πάλιν
ἀναλύεσθαι· οἷον ἡ ψιχή, φησιν, ἡ ἡμετέρα
ἀὴρ οὖσα συγκρατεῖ ἡμᾶς. So also did
Diogenes of Apollonia, the pnpil of
Anaxilnenes; cf. R. and P. ἓ 163, where
Simplicius quotes from him. [It is not
at all clear whether Anaximenes meant
by ἀήρ what Cic. means by animm pro-
bably not.]

nam et agere...sentent1a: Cic. is
shewing by examples that the Romans
generally used the words animus and

anima interchangeably, anima in ageret
animam and ffare animam having the ³>

same meaning (‘spirit') as animus in
animosus and ex animi sententia.

animus ab anima: the two words are
one in origin, and the meaning ‘air' 01·
‘breath’ is undoubtedly earlier than the
meaning ⁶ soul.' VVhere a word has both
a physical and a psychical meaning the
physieal is, as a general principle, the
earlier.

Zenom' animus ignis uidetur: rather
πνεῦμα ἔνθερμον (Diog. Laert. vii 157),
i.e. not ordinary fire but warm breath.
See Zeller, c. ix, pp. 199, 200. The
distinctive characteristic os air was cold
while that of fire was heat, Diog. L. vii
136. The soul was therefore more akin
to tire than to air, and may therefore be
described as (grain cf. Stob. i 314 quoting
Chrysippus λέγεσθαι δὲ πῦρ τὸ πυρῶδες
πᾶν καὶ ἀέρα τὸ ἀερῶδες καὶ ὁμοίως τὰ
λοιπά. See also 18, 42 n.; N.D. ii 15,
41 soll.; R. and 125 398, and passages
there cited from Stob. Ecl. i p. 538.

X. ξ 20. uolgo: sc. opinantur.
F. A. Wolf- and Kuh. take this to mean
‘these views are held by entire schools as
contrasted with singuli individual philo-
sophers.’ But Ι cannot think of any
parallel to such a use os uolgo, and I
prefer to translate ⁶ are views which com-
mend themselves to the multitude-² Cf.
Camerarius in Mo. ‘Vulgares quidem esse
ait has sententias de animo, corporeum
illum esse: sed incorporeum fecisse nobi-
lissimos philosophos.' Nor is this view
excluded by the fact that some great
philosophers had taken the soul to con-
sist of some one or other of these sub-
stances.

ut multi ante ueteres: Kuh. explains
‘ut (maluti, “as for example'’) multi
ante ueteres philosophi suam quisque
de animi natura protulerunt opinionem,
