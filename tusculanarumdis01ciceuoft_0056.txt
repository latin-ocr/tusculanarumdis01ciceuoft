lii INTRODUCTJON

i for a.

1554 pinxit for panxit, an idea as to the meaning contributing. As
a and u often interchanged, the misreading of i for α is of the same kind
as the misreading of i for u.

e for a.

1 5 1 16 constet for constat; 5 1 18 plene for plane; 11 5 37 foret sorferat 3

542 (if we follow Sff.) εἶθ for ai03 542 permanentibus for perma-
nantibus.

α for e.

Ι 5 13 recordare for recordere3 5 18 putant for putent 3 520 se parare
for ei parere 3 5 106 semias for semiesas (see above, under Haplograplzy) ;
11 5 6 philosophantur for plzzlosoplzentur3 5 3 5 efficiat for ffciet.

s for e.

1 54 grgcis sor greciffi 520 se parare for ei parere. The converse e

for s is presented by B 2 in 538 eezmcare for senocare where all other MSS
have reuocare.

e for c.
11516 se for sc.
l for c.

1561 and 11 5 60 tum for cum.

c for t.

1571 cum for tam. 583 ecquidem for ec quidem.

s for p.

λ 1 5 108 supplicos (sublices E) for publicos the letter p having been in
some way obscured.

s for t.

1 5 119 if quos be changed to quot with second-rate MSS. 11 5 67
omittas for omittat.

p for t.

11 5 5 praeferant for transferant, a contraction being perhaps the
principal cause of the error. If taetra were read for pt'rd (per terram)
in 1 5 106 we should have another instance.

le for e.

1573 reuertens for reverens.

Similarly ce for e.

11 5 23 clucet for cluet: cf. 1 5 54 cicelur E for cietur.
