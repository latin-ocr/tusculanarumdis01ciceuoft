including the best, with the notable ex-
ception of V, have inserted the words
iussu tyrannorum from ten lines lower
down (ᾗ 96). As it is not conceivable
that the copyists could separately make
this mis-take, the natural conclusion is
that all these MSS spring from a single
source.

mollissimis: molestissimis is the read-
ing of all the best MSS, and it is worth
noting that no variant is supplied by the
early corrector of V. Yet the objection
Of Bent. that with it we should expect
crassatum* or lorquemnr, not cffi’mz'mz-
mur, is forcibIe, and modern editors
read mollissimis with most late MSS and
early editions.

of evils, Cato M. 1, 2 ‘onere...aut iam

especially of troops, e.g. Art. viii 3, 7
‘Afranium (a friend) cum magnis copiis

sumus: it 15 1101 necessary with Or.

magnis quibusdam: quibusdam, by
its vagueness, here dispamges, cf. i 12,

’ ξ 96. exspectando et, desiderando:
abl. of attendant circumstances.

animis: so the best and nearly all MSS·
Ursinus read animi which he found in
1115 Δ115, and Bent. approved. VVes. Em.
iii p. 27 also thinks animi probably
right3 and it is the usual form in Cicero,
but in Livy vii 30, η MSS read ‘quid
illis 1105 sollicitis ac pendentibus animis
renuntiare iubetis?’ There however
Weissenborn, after Sigonius and Gron.‚
reads animi, with great probability. See
XVes. Em. i p. 29 [Madv. Em. Lz'v.
p. 180} animi is read in our passage
by the early corrector of V.

Theramenes: as one of the Thirty
Tyrants he ultimately opposed the
cruelty of his colleagues, especially that
of Critias, and was condemned to death.
For his character see Grote‚ Hz‘st. of
Graece, vol. VIII c. 65.
