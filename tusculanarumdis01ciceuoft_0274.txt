support) and giving the whole line to
Patroclus. lx'uh. and Mo. give these
words to Eurypylus and an excellent
sense is thus obtained. But 1 do not
like the rhythm quiesce egitur with
synizesis in quiesce and metrical accent
on the middle syllable of igilur. As I
refer the words to Cic. (see below) I
take thern to be prose.

(2) To whom and by whom are these
words spoken?

TS.‚ reading as in the text, takes the
words to be addressesl to Eur. (by Cic. as
spectator) ‘Be quiet then and attend to
the binding of your wound'; but, though
they thus smooth the difficulty over, can
alliga bear this meaning? Can ‘bind
your wound' mean ‘get your wound
bound’? Dav. s‘ff. Kl. Hei. also give
these words to Cicero who comments
upon the situation as if it were being
enacted before him. ‘Be quiet then and
bind the wound.’

The whole passage is part of the argu-
ment that pain must be despised. and that
it can be overcome by endurance wh. can
be developed by practice, preparation,
habituation. Military training is a good
kind of preparation. Eurypylus illus-
trates the effect of this training. He is
in no hurry to have his wound dressed,
and Patroclus, assuming or knowiug him
to be a despiser of pain, asks him ques-
tions about the fortune of the army iu-
stead of binding his wouud at once.
quiesce igilur is best referred to Cicero,
who, assuming the mental attitude ofa
spectator sympathising with the wounded
man, wishes Patroclus to bind the wound
at once. It is addressed to Patroclus as
111 1116 immediate context surprise was ex-
pressed that P. should not attend to the
wound without delay. To refer the
words to Eurypylus would, besides giv-
ing a doubtful metrical form of words,
be open to the objection that it would
rather detract froin the fortitude dis-
played by Eur. instead of helping for-
ward the argument.

(3) XVhether do the words etiam si
Eur. posset non posset Aesopus refer to
quieuere supplied from quiesce, as TS.
thinks, or to cxplz'care in dolore following,
as K'uh. supposes, or to eafizrz' tanlmn
dictis quantum saclis suppetit labaris, as
Or. and Mo. take them to do? The first
view is favoured only by the position of

haec toris E.

the words quiesce. . alliga. Otherwise this
and the second view seem alike untenable.

(4) What is the ref. iu Aesopus mm
posset? sff. and ΤΞ. think that a com-
pliment to Aesopus, who was Cie.'s
friend (Diu. i 37, 80), is conveyed by
the words. The compliment is not
obvious. K'uh. thinks the meaning is
‘even if the real Eur. could have set
forth the story beginning ubi fortuna
Hectoris...the stage Eun, i.e. Aesopus,
not being trained lo lmm'slll'p‚ could not
have done so ι] lle had been zetomzded.'
Though this would connect the mention
of Aes. with the argument it seems far-
fetched, and the asyndeton would be very
remarkable. Another and rather better
view is that the recitation of such a
description (mm polis ecfin’i...lal›07·is)
would not have suited the style of
Aesopus' aeting. We find in Off. i 31,
114 that the character of Aiax Furens
did not suit him. The passage in Diu. i
37, So throws light 011 some character-
istics of his actingv in Aesopo familiari
tao santum ardorem nolluum atque
meatuum (uidi), ut eum uis quaedam ab·
sima-isse a sensu menlz's uideretur. Hei.
seems to take this view.

With all explanations however the
passage is unsatisfactory and emenda-
tion seems necessary. §chuta suspected
that the clause etiam si Eumrpylus...
Aesopus should come before the clause
qniesce...all1gra. Perhaps some words
have fallen out after Aesopus. In any
case the line ubi fortuna... is introduced
very abruptly.

[I am convinced that [annuat and
