animo: animus of nearly all MSS can-
not be right; that this [inimus within the
space of six words should receive an
animus of its own seems impossible.

The Creator might be expected to be
referred to as an objective reality, but the
character or quality of the Creator is in
point and accounts for the subjunctive.
