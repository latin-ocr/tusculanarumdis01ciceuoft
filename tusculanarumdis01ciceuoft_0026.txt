passions and desires from that of the reason. Heine therefore con-
cludes that he was well fitted to supply the material for all this part
(gg 26-81) including the arguments drawn from the Phaedo, Phaedrus
and Meno, which he finds1 so interwoven with Stoic views and
expressions that they can hardly, as he thinks, be taken directly from
Plato. In the second part of the book (ἐξ 82—117) the numerous
passages which are common to the Tusculan Disputations and Plutarch⁷s
Consolatio ad Apollonium shew that these two works must have had a
common source, and Plutarch expressly refers in four places to Crantor's
περὶ Πέιιθους as his source. Cicero was familiar with this work of
Crantor and drew from it material for his own Consolatio. The coinci-
dences are set forth in detail by O. Heine‘2, §91 notura si se sic
lmoet ut quo modo inm'um..., with Plut. c. 15 3 §92 habes somnum
imaginem mortis with Plut. c. 12 3 ξ 93 ante fempus mori miserem with
Plut. cc, 18, 23, 24, 283 g 94 apud Hypanim flmcimn..bestiolas with
Plut. c. 17. Both works also contain the stories of Cleobis and Biton,
Trophonius and Agamedes Silenus, Midas, and the Terinean Elysius.
Ι may add that Plut. also notices the death of Theramenes, p. 105 b.

The quotation from Callimachus Tusa. Disp. i ἕ 93 is given in
Plutarch without mention of Callimachus (c. 24) μεῖον γὰρ ὄντως Τρωίλος
ἐδάκρυσεν ἢ Πρίαμος. Heine thinks that Crantor (who was dead by
270 Rc.) can scarcely have quoted Callimachus (who died about 240 B.C.).
He thinks that Cicero and Plutarch had a later source in common. The
epigram of Callimachus upon Cleombrotus, quoted by Cic. 1 ᾖ 84, is
not in Plutarch, but Heine thinks that it was probably in their common
source. Corssen³ thought that Posidonius was the source for all the
matter contained in the first book of the Tusculan DisputationS. In
that case Cicero might have found Callimachus' epigram in Posidonius.
But Heine seems right in finding it improbable that Posidonius should
have copied a work so well known and so widely read in his day as
that of Crantor, and in laying stress on the fact that Plutarch always
refers to Crantor, and not to Posidonius, as his source.

i.e. to Crantor, since the argument is the same. Heine notes, inter alz'a,
that Crantor employed this argument (that the dead are not unhappy
since they have ‘not any consciousness nor even any existence), comparing
Tusc. Disp. i {87 foll. with Plut. Cons. ad Apoll. c. 15, but says that
Cicero's argument is specially Epicurean and thinks Cicero’s treatment
