⁴ nec enirn ueri simile est hominem soli-
tarium tris tani ualidos euitasse iuuenes‚’
quoted by Bouhier: a bold formation cha—
racteristic of earlier Latin. [Cf. Plautus'
domi domitus Men. 105]

ui uitam euitart...turpari: sor the
παρήχησις and ὀμοιοτέλευτον cf. 28, 69 n.

turpari, ‘to be stained.'

ista ui ε ui, the emendation of Petrus
Crassus‚has been accepted by Man. Lamb.
Stephanus. Mo. Or. Hei. Sff. TS. and
most editors for uel of most MSS. Cf. ¹ ιη’
uitam euitari.' Scht'ttz and Klotz retain
uel, but fail to elicit a satisfactory sense
from the passage.

potuerit: for the tense see 22, 50 n.
on ‘ quasi uero intellegant.'

occidisset, talem ε most mss read
accidisset tamen..., a few inferior MSS
read lum. accidisset, retained by Tr.
and Sffi, would have for its subject ista
uis, which would be absurd since isla uis
would then be subject to amisisset and to
amisit and it is part of the mala which
it would thus be said to have escaped.
Priamus is understood as nom. to ami·
sisset and to amisit. Even if we supplied
from the context not isla uis but mors as
nom. to accidisset, this loosely supplied
nom. would, with further looseness of
construction, be nom. to amisisset and
to amisit. oscz'disset, accepted by most
editors, involves the changing of a single
letter. The corruption was no doubt
due to the preceding accidere. Bentley
says that ‘priscae editiones’ have occi-
disset. tamen is retained by Or. Sff.
Kl. but this involves taking euentum
with malorum in the sense of ‘the oc-
currence of evils' as contrasted with the
sensus malorum, and euentus in this sense
would be hard to parallel, though mala
euenerunt is common, cf. ἕ 86 ‘haec

mala...etiam si non euenerunt.’ lum is
open to the sanie objections as lamen.
talem, conj. by Steph- and Bentley and
adopted by Mo. Bai. Ilei. Ts. Ml. and
Schiche, gives excellent sensezlam tris-
tem euentum.

amisisset has been greatly suspected.
Is sound it can only be taken as Biller-
beck took it, as improprie quidem sed
iocose diclztm, a view also adopted by
Ktih. Sch‘utz proposed to cut out amisis-
set as a marginal gloss, and thought the
construction a case of zeugma; but Mo.
(Exc. Vol. 11 p. 364) objects that it is
not usual 111 zeugma for a verb to be
omitted which must be supplied in a
different mood and different tense.

Sall. Iug. 14, 23 ‘non enim regnum,
sed sugam, exsilium, egestatem et
aerumnas cum anima simul amisisti,'
quoted by Hei. and earlier by Olivet, is
not parallel to our passage; for, as Mo.
observes, in aerumnas amillere only one
word is used minus proprie and the use
is explained by the use of another word
sensu proprio, but here we have a double
κατάχρησις, euentum amittere and sensum
amittere malornm. Ι arn therefore not
satisfied that the reading which I have
followed is what Cicero actually wrote,
and I think the emendation of Hottinger,
adopted by Mo„ talem ezcentum omnino
non habuisset very probable. Hottinger
supposed non (ηό) 10 have fallen out
after -no 111 omnino and then habuisset,
become meaningless, to have been al-
tered into amisisset. He compares Diu.
ii 9, 22 ‘quae enim uita fuisset Priamo,
si ab adulescentia scisset quos euentus
senectutis esset habiturus.' For the whole
passage cf. Juv. x 283 soll. [amisisset is
certainly wrong and omisisset, wh. I have
seen proposed, is no better; dimisisset
(i ξ 12) is possible.]
