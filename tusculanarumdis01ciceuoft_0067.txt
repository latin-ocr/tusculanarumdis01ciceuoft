but asp, asc· not adsp-, adso, cf. aspice ιι 19, aspeximus 11 58, aspicere
ιι 65. ,

Also (usually) acc-‚ all„ a1›1)-‚ urr-, att-, cf. alligra 11 39, 66, appellata
G in 11 43, 66, apellari V G 11 7 <but in the rarcr words adprobant ιι 8
and adpetentissimi 11 58, assimilation has not taken place), arripuerit
1 110, arripe 11 203 attulit 1 58, but V P adtulisse 1 39. Cf. Fleckeisen,
Rmfzzgr Α rtikeln, 1). 173 Bran] bach, rWugcstaltung der lateinischeu
Ortlutgy‘apllie pp. 296—9.

Comm-‚ comp- are the regular forms, cf. commotus 1 7, commemini
1 13, commentemur 1 7 5, complecti 1 51, comparat ιι 2 RV 135151,
(conparat G P), comprimit 11 53, conl· more rarely coll-, cf. conloquio
1 101 VG, cotzlocel 11 39, conlocari 11 64, but colligit 1 58: conr-, cf.
conroboret G in 11 41· Cf. Fleckeisen, pp. 17, ¹83 Bramhach, pl). 300—
302.

The prefix ec· is preserved in ecferant 1 41, ecferendi 1 4 3, ecferitatem
11 20. Cf. Fleck. p. 203 Neue Formenlehre 11 766 foll.

Where ex· is prefixed to a word beginning with s the mss usually
retain s, eg. exstet 1 37. Cf. Fleck. p. 383 Braml). pp. 278-280.

In· is seldom assimilated. Cf. z'nbntusl 14, inbecillitate 11 15 3 inpulsa
1 53, inparatus 1 86, inponam 1 95 (hut imperabit 11 51, imperatori 11 62) 3
inlacrima 1 21, inrisi 11 3, inruebant 11 59. Cf. Fleck. p. 183 Brambach,
PP- 299-302. .

The spelling of compounds of iacio with ii, where the original a has
sunk to i, seems to be supported hythe variants in 11 56 elici for eici and
11 27 ducuntur and dicuntur for eiciuntur, but in 11 67 eice is read by
RVG Β Ρ Ε L. See explanatory note on 11 ξ 56.

With the Mss and most editors Ι have retained the forms abisset
1 32, obisset 1 86, audisset 1 102, but Ι think they may be due to
haplography.

In 1 46 1 have retained the contracted comprendimus, but Ι suspect
this form to be due to compllendimus.

Accusatives plural in -is from i- stems are usual. The rules given
in Fleckeisen, p. 13, generally apply.

In many instances the best MSS present the superlative in -umus, but
there are many others in which they have -imns without any variant.
The two forms seem to have co-existed (cf. Bramb. p. 14). The question
is so complicated that in many particular instances it would be difficult
to decide between these forms, especially as I did not take down all
the Ms evidence on this point from the commencement of my collation.
Ι have therefore thought it better to spell in all cases with -imus.
