quia cum tantum operae: this pas-
sage as it stands in the MSS cannot be
sound. Ktih. emended by inserting et
after dedissem, a position from which it
certainly might easily fall out (dcdissf ἕ).
Before qm'a he supplies in thought from
the preceding clause llaec ratic) me dc
sententia deduxit, and he accounts for
the repetition of the conclusion, first
stated in quia c·l!lll...ll!allllll csse dolorem
and again in plurimos..‚malum est ᾖςίῐίιν
dolor, by referring the former statement
to the time when Dionysius drew that
conclusion under the infl-uence of pain,
and the latter to the time when he con-
versed with Cleanthes. Muther‚ quoted
with approval by Kuh„ proposed quia

this has been adopted by Tr. Bai. Ml.

lend itself to any theory as to how the
word came to fall out. I prefer to place
it aster dedissem (wi εἰ) where Sff„ after
Bogem inserted it. The reading thus¹
arrived at is, I think, more natural than
that of Kuh„ while the alteration is
almost equally slight and equally prob-
able. We have then a syllogism of

which the major premiss is in hypotheti-
cal form, cnm lallflml...si...7lon possem,

is plurinum* aulem...716c...possum; and
the conclusion malum est igilur dolam
aud we know that the Stoics tended to
couch their arguments in syllogistic form
and made much nse of hypothesis in
doing so (see Zeller‚ Stoics, etc. p. ιι2);
and Dionysius having become familiar
while a Stoic with this mode of expres-
sion could not abandon it so readily as
he abandoned Stoic ethics.

The subjunctives possem and esset
are due to reported thought. The words
os D. in ον. recta would have been (um
dedissem sz'...mm poteram salis erasm.
cum = ‘whereas‚' ‘although,' cf. i 17,
3911. on ‘cum adduxeris.⁷

ex Epigonis : cf. de Opt. Gen. Or. 6,
18 ⁶ nec Andromacham igitur aut Anti-
opam, aut Epigonos Latinos recipiant.
sed tamen Ennium, et Pacuuium, et
Accium potius¹ quam Euripidem et Sopho·
[ίειη,’ srom whence it is clear that the
version of Accius was derived from the
Ἐπίγονοι of Sophocles, not, as Dav.
supposes, from that of Aesch) lus. The
play of Aeschylus is referred to and
quoted from by the Scholiast on Pindar
Isth. 6, 10.

From Aecius' Epigoni Nonius 342
quotes a line, and the line in the text
is no doubt taken from that play,
Cleanthes' line being from the play of
Sophocles. The Lat. play is also men-
tioned in Off. i 31, 114. For several
other reff. to this play of Accius, chiefly
from Nonius, see Ribb. Scaea. Rom.
Poes. Fmg. i pp. 173—6.
