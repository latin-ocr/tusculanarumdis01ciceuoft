Ml. and Ilei. read (μισ (without in) : the
book may be said to restore the man
when it represents him as restored z but
surely no one would prefer quo to sn quo
here, unless on the ground os greater
closeness to the MS reading; and is the
theory given above accounts for in, this
ground falls away.

possem: possum would be as appro-
priate here as in ξ 83 “uere et iure
possum.⁷ and the indicative construction
is the usual one. Or. followed by Mo.
and Kiih. thinks both constructions
equally correct, explaining possum i.e.
sz' uoluer03 possem i.e. si uellem, but
possum si uellem is the usual idiom, ‘I
have the power if Ι chose to exercise it.⁷
In Sall. Cat. 7, 7 possem may be supposed
due to the attraction of traheret which is
expressed in the context, but possum, as
quoted by Servius, may be the true reading
there. In Or. i 9, 38 si uclz'm...j>osst'm
the subj. is due to attraction. Fleckeisen
in philol. lv 3²5 (OS.) would read pos-
sum here, and in Nepos Epam. 4, 6
possumus for possemus: Gud. has possi-
mus which often interchanges with
possumus.

qui et. domesticis ..... abstraxisset ε
The rel. qui is attracted out of the
abstraxisset clause into the sz' clause, a
well—known construction, as Ktih. ob-
serveS‚ comparing 43, 102 ‘cui cum
Lysimachus. . .minaretur (pro qui, cum. . . )’;
Ν.Ϊ). iii 14, 35 ‘quiquoniam quid diceret
intellegi noluit, omittamus’3 p. Flacco
36. 90 ⁶ ergo is, quisi aram tenens iuraret,
crederet nemo, per epistolam quod uolet
iniuratus probabit.’ But all irregularity
would not be removed from the sentence,
as Kiih. seems to suppose, if certe had
stood before νισι-,νς for we should still
have a redundaney in nos which would
only be paralleled if we had ‘hunc
omittamus' in N.D. above, or ‘ez' cre-
deret ’ in p. Flacco above 3 and domesticis
et fhrmsibus solaciis ornamentisque priuati

accurate-ly expressed‚ for the meaning of
ante is ante fluam ila firmaremur. Strictl y
Cic. should have written qui, si ante
quam d. ets. s. ornamentz'squepriuarem αν,
occidissemus. morte* ιι malis, certe mm ιι
bonis abslmcli essemus. But Cic. has
preferred the more vigorous use of the
active voice and personifieation of mors.
his meaning being equally clear. Ι
therefore agree with Mo. against Ktih.
that we have an anacolouthon here.

domesticis et forensibus solaciis orna.-
mentisque: salamis refers specially to
domesticis. the reference being to the loss
of his daughter Tullia (26, 65 n.) ; while
ornamentis refers to sorensiltm, the dis-
tinctions of public life open to him before
Caesar gained autocratic power, cf. 25,
62 n. lx'iib. compares Fam. v ¹5 ‘quod
enim mihi poterat esse perfugium spoliato
et domesticis et forensibus ornamentis
atque solaciis? '

XXXV. 3· 85.' habeat...aeceperit:
subjunctives of quality or class, cf. 6,
12 n. The argument, somewhat obscure
here. is well stated by TS.‚ who finds
implied as apodosis num eum morte a
bonis abstrahi parabimus J? The argument
is somewhat as follows z The rule mors a
malis non a hom's abstrahi! is absolute,
whether we take the case of a man like
Metellus whose fortune was uniformly
good throughout his career, or that of
men like l‘riam or Pompey, who out-
lived their good fortune. For all were
equally exposed to misfortune so long as
they lived (cf. in utroque...)‚ and death
removes every one from possible if not
from actual evil. cf. 36, 86 ‘haec morte
...quia possunt euenire.⁷ Had Priam died
before Fortune turned, his case would
have seemed to furnish a greater instance
of good fortune than that of Metellus (cf.
at quinquaginta Priamus). Cic. is not
troubled by the fact that no calamity‚ in
whi;h Metellus would probably hare
shared had he lived longer, besell the
family of Metellus after his death.
