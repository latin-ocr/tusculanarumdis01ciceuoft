(c) Analysis of Mis· crrors.

The MS authority for the text of the 'l‘usculan Disputations is
decidedly good. In the books contained in the present edition there
is no corrupt passage that does not admit of a satisfactory emendation
such that the existing Ms readings can be explained upon principles
generally recognised, and very often where the best mss are in error the
true reading is found in one or more of the later MSs. 'l‘he errors of the
principal MSS may be classified under the following heads :—

(i) Glosses.

1 3· 3 qni fnit maior natu qnam Plantas et A'aezu'us. g 7 operam
before dedimus. §22 alia after et tam multa. ἓ 52 sit lzoc se ipsum
posse cognoscere, sit being no doubt a copyist's error for sc. = scilicet, and
the clause perhaps containing a gloss upon a gloss, as suggested in the
explanatory notes, ,ξ 54 semper before moneat, brought in from ἓ 53.
§65 lzoc before expressimus. §76 nt after ratione. ἓ 77 contemnit.
§86 non liberi defleti, non fortunae omnes a uictoribus possiderentur.
ἓ 101 qnid ille dux...ntgebant.

11 g 30 dnm after gloriantem. I take dnm to have arisen from dm z
dicentem placed in the margin to explain the construction, and subse-
quently copied into the text. In V dnm is over an erasure. V¹ may
have had dm. §36 In seurota, the reading of R, Ι think that s must
have come from the margin, where Ι take it to have been placed to come
at the end of the word eurota. ξ 55 fletus for lessus.

(ii) Transpositions.

1 ξ 37 imagines mortuorum for mortuorum imagines. These words
would be very weak as a remark of Cicero, and they are hardly a gloss,
for they add to the lucidity of the passage, their presence being almost
implied in lias tamen imagines. ἕ 67 fortasse quamquam for quamquam
fortasse. §88 carere in malo non dicitur; nec enim esset dolendnm;
dicitur illud: bono carere, quod est malum Wrongly placed in the MSS
after facile patiare instead of before carere igitur lcoc significat, if my
conjecture is correct. §94 auita for ita ant with the loss of a letter,
and ἓ 113 Binoto for Biton with the addition of a letter. g 95 iussu
