qui item: this reading, introduced by
Dav. as an emendation, is found in V by
correction. 11 has been generally ae-
cepted and is probably right. Mo. reads
‘qui oraculo) qui deorum oraculo may
occur to some one as a probable con-
jecture, and qui dem-4. oraculo would very

easily be corrupted by haplography into
qm'de07‘acul03 but a'corum would bear an
unnatural emphasis since oraculum with-
out deorum has just preceded. ilem 011

oraculo, and the corruption from qni item
to quitem, which being meaningless would
be changed into quedem, would be one of
the most usual kind.
