Minos : few now have doubts as to the
reality and power of Minos. For the
latest notice of the discoveries at Cnossus,
which have helped to convince the most
sceptical, see l). G. Hogarth 111 Quarlerly

ad aram: cf. Plutarch Inst. Lacon. p.
²39 d z——once a year at Sparta a flogging
competition (διαμαστίγωσις) was held 111
which boys endured the whole day long
to be torn with whips (ξαινόμενοι μάστιξι)
31 1116 altar οἷ”Αρτεμις Ὀρθία, persisting
in some 63565 1111111 they died under the
lash, the object of the contest being to de-
termine who should longest and best hold
out. 111 Lycurg. 10 Plut. says that he
saw them dying under 1116 13511, 311(1
Lucian in Anacharsis c. 38 says that
statues were set up to those who so died.
The victor bore the title of βωμονίκας.
111 Boeckh, Corp. lnscr. Graec. 1364 b,
the honours of one Tib. Claudius Sophron
are set forth, the first mentioned being
that he was βωμονίκας. Tertullian ad
Mart. c. iv says the practice was regularly
maintained in his day (about 200 A.D. ).

Τ116 meaning of the custom is very clear
from Philostratus and Pausanias z—Philo-
stratus (Apoll. Tyaneus vi 20) says that
the flogging was in honour of 1116
Scythian Artemis and that it was said
to have been ordered by oracles3 that

Pausanias, iii 16, 7, says that earlier a
man 61105611 by lot was sacriticed in
obedience to an oracle which declared
that the altar ought to be stained with
human blood and that Lycurgus changed
the practice. See also Sext. Empir.
Pyrrh. Hypot. iii ²4 ; and Miiller, Dom'ans
1 398 (E.'s.); Seyffert, Dies. Class. Ant.
s.v. Artemis. The practice of offering
human sacrifices to a goddess with the
attributes of Artemis was very wide-
spread, but, just as in the case of the
worship of Diana at Aricia, this Spartan
worship 1135 sabled to have been trans-
planted srom the Tauri. For the human
sacrifices there cf. Eurip. 1.Τ. ad im'l.
and Frazer’s Golden liouglz, ad init.

As the object of the proceedings was
to cover the altar with blood, all or nearly
all the competitors 1111151 have bled, hence
multus rather than mullis gives the
meaning required.

uerberibus accipiuntur: usually, when
this verb is used of unpleasant things,
there 15 irony; afficiuntur (a reading
weakly supported) is more what we
should expect from Cicero ; but Cic. may
here 11316 in 11611 1116 cheerfulness and

Moreover the word seems seriously used
111 iv 36, 78 ‘quo te modo accepissem,
inquit, nisi iratus essem-² There is even
room for a shade of irony in both
passages.
