sets forth arguments for the immortality of the soul. But in §82 he com—
mences the second division of his subject and, from that point to the end
of the book, maintains that, even though the soul perish as completely
as the body, there is no evil in death. After maintaining in ,ξ 82 that
the act of dying involves no evil, and in ,Q 83—6 that the necessity
of leaving behind the good things of life involves no evil, and that one
is more likely to leave evil behind than good, he maintains in ξ 87 that,
even assuming tlzal in dying we deparl from good things (md not from
evil, death is m’verllzeless no evil. For (by HVPOTHEsls assumed
throughout Q 82—117) there is no feeling in death, and where there

, is no feeling there can be no privation <cat-ere). Even to the living

there is no privation in being without those things of which they have
no need. In §88 he reiterates (cf. premendum etiam atque etiam) the
argument stated in ,ξ 87, reminding us, as a preliminary, to hold
firmly to the principle that there is no feeling whatever in death,
a principle which, on our hypothesis that the soul is mortal, cannot
be disputed.

Here then Cicero is arguing that, even though in dying we depart
from good things and not from evil, death is no evil. His positions are
the following :—

(i) A man is not said carere in respect of evils (except in a few
phrases like febri carere).

(ii) He is not even said carere in respect of good things unless
he has need of thern, no, not even when [ιε is alive and can feel.

(iii) Much less then can he be said carere in respect of good things
when he is dead and cannot feel.

To translate the emended passage in detail: “We must sift the
meaning of carere, lest any source of error be left in the word. We
cannot use the word carere with reference to evil, for evil (when we
have it) would not in that case be a thing about which to grieve,
we speak of lacking good things, this being an evil. (These Cicero
takes to be facts generally recognised with reference to the use of the
word.) The meaning then of carere is to lack a thing which one desires
to have. For wish is implied in the word, except when we use it in
another sense, as in the phrase febri carere. For the word is used
in another sense (of which febri carere is a particular instance), when
there is something that one has not, and he is aware of the fact though
he may also be glad of it. But even when alive a man does not lack
a good thing (this second sense of the word applying only to bad things)
unless he has need of it. It is true that in the case of a living man it is
at least an intelligible mode of expression to speak e.g. of you (Le. of
a man) as lacking a throne, although this cannot with much accuracy
