putations were published (editis) before the books De lValura Deorum
were written (so the word perfectis seems generally understood), since
we find the collection of material for the latter work begun on the
5th August, we should place the (late of composition of the Tusculan
Disputations between the zoth July and the 5th August. If the books
could be spoken on five asternoons they could no doubt bc written
out in fifteen days. But this would have involved working twice as
fast as he worked over the writing of the De Finibus. There would
seem to be no reason for this acceleration of the rate of speed at
which he worked, and, as we shall see below that the second at least
of the books De Diuiuatioue was not written till after Caesar's death,
this theory would allow Cicero seven months and ten (lays for the
writing of the De Μιίηνιι Deorum, the Cato stlaior, and the first book
De Dz'ut'ualiom’. As he was in or near Rome during most of that
time, this sudden change from double speed to a little over quarter
speed would be unaccountable, especially as we find him working fast
again during the period between the middle of March and the end of
October in the year 44 ss.C.

It is true that Cicero does not seem usually to have had more than
one philosophic work in hand at a time. The recasting of the
characters and rearranging the division into books of the Academics is
hardly an exception. But there are remarkable internal resemblances
between the Tusculan Disputations and the De Natura Deorum. No
other two works of Cicero have so much in common, and Ι think it
very probable that for some reason Cicero may have worked at both
of these subjects dur-ing the same period. And this theory, if correct,
may throw light upon the meaning of the word perfectis in the passage
in De Diuz'uatz'oue referred to above. After Cicero had got the Tusculan
Disputations off his hands by publication (editis) he proceeded to com<
plete (peffectis) the De Natura Deorum with which he had also been
occupied.

3. In Att. xv 2, 4 we find Cicero wrsting, on the 18th May, 44,
quod prima disputatio Tusculana se confirmat sane gaudeo. And in Att.
xv 4, 2 on the 2 3rd May, redeamus igitur ad Tusculanas disputationes.
These extracts shew that the work had been published before the
18th May, 44, but they do not prove, as Heine (Ez'ul. p. iii) and
others seem to assume, that Atticus received the book only about that
time. Cicero was very anxious at that time. In a letter of the 4th May
he says that it was less dangerous to speak against the party of the
tyrant du‘ring his life than after his death. Atticus was also anxious,
certainly on Cicero's account, possibly on his own. It is evident that
he had written to Cicero (mainly perhaps to fortify him) stating that he
