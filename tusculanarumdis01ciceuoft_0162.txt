apart from certain cum-clauses, for which
see Draeger, Hisl. Synl. 11 ᾗ· 498 p. 544,
1 a, and certain other cmxl-clauses treated
of by Dr. in snb-sections b and c, which
seem to admit of another explanation,
there seems no proof that Cic. used the
iterative suhj.. and we are not justified in
thrusting the 1156 upon him by emenda-
tion. The same objection applies to
Deiter's conjecture qui lam acriter in
Philologus XLVI p. 176.

This passage is taken pretty closely
from Phaedo p. 99d ”μὴ πάθοιμι ὅπερ οἳ
τὸν ἥλιον ἐκλείποντα θεωροῦντες καὶ
σκοπούμενοι· διαφθείρονται ’γάρ που ἔνιοι
τὰ ὄμματα, ἐὰν μὴ ἐν ὕδατι ἥτινι τοιούτῳ
σκοπῶνται τὴν εἰκόνα αὑτοῦ.’

[Τ116 ut-clause has all the appearance
of being genuine, and an explanation of
quod. quicumque may be the right
reading]

aspectum: cf. v 38, 111 ‘etiam si
non adhibeatur aspectus '3 v 39, 114
‘inpediri...animi aciem aspectu ocu-
lorum.'

se ipsa intuens: see 23, 54 n. We
should have expected ipsam here, as the
contrast is to solem intuens, but the MS
authority is more in favour of ipsa, and
the norn- is more emphatic. So often,
cf. p. Sulla 13, 39 ‘de se ipse confessus
esset.'

circumspectans t
plies anxiety, ef. Tac. Agr. 32 ‘mare et
siluas, ignota omnia circumspectantes.‘

multa aduersa reuerens: renas-ens
seems a necessary corr. for reuertens of
most MSS. reuerens is rare 111 Cic. in
the sense of ⁴ dreading‚' but cf. Or. ii 28,
122 ‘dicam enirn non reuerens adsen-
tandi suspicionem.'

dently before his mind the passage in
Phaedo 85 (1 δεῖν ’γὰρ περὶ αύτὰ...ἦ...
ἢ εἰ ταῦτα ἀδύνατον τὸν ’γοῦν βέλτιστον
τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων λόγων λαβόντα καὶ
δυσεξελεγκτότατον, επὶ τούτου ὀχούμενον,
ὤσπερ ἐπὶ σχεδίας κινδυνεύοντα διαπλεῦ-
σαι τὸν βίον.’

MsS here have oratio. Many editors
have altered this to ratio to represent
λόγος, but λόγος (16110165 not only ratio
but oratio. Kiih. therefore follows Mo.
in taking Cic. to have understood λόγος
as = oratio personified

1 have adopted Sff.’ 5 reading tamquam

for which there is much to be said,
whether we alter to φαίη) with him or
retain 0771le as explained by Mo. and
Ktih.; ‘our utterance is borne along
like some skiff upon a boundless sea.’
There seems no fitness in our ‘utterance’
or our ‘ theory' being z'n a skiff and (a
point not put forward by Sff.) it 15 not so
in the Platonie passage, but we ourselves
are embarked upon the λόγος as upon
3 rast. Sff. explains the in of the best
MSS by dittography after the m of tam-
quam and rate as corrupted from rati' =
ratis. It is a point in favour of ratio
that we could embark on a plan better
than on an oratio.

As oratio 6311 116 explained it may be
retained, but Sff. remarks ‘Oratio et
ratio inter se permixta sunt in G et R
praeter hunc locum i 112, 116. iii 76,
ν 47‚' and Kuh. gives other instanees.
Strongly in favour of the readings ratis
and oratio here are iv 5, 9 ‘utrum pan-
derem uela orationis’ and iv 14, 33
‘quoniam tamquam ex scrupulosis co-
tibus enauigauit oratio‚' in which passages
the oratio sails like a ratis.
