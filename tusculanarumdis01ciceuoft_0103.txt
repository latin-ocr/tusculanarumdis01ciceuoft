(a) The natural effect of quidam is to
add vagucmws. Osten the word has no
further effect, eg. ii 4, 10 ‘a tali quodam
ductus exordio)

(b) It is litted sor apologising, as here,
sor the use of a word in a metaphorical
sense, cf. i 2ο, 46 ‘uiae quasi quaedam'3
ii 6, 16 ‘quaedam generosa uirtus.y

(c) With words osa certain class its
effect is to z'ntensisjt their meaning: the
imagination makes a vague sear a great
fear, eg. ii 4, 10 ‘metus quidam,' or a
thing vaguely great very great, eg. i 27,
66 ‘singularis quaedam.’

(d) In i 40, 95 ‘magnis quibusdam
bonis’ the use is really the same as in
singularis quaedam, but the added vagne-
ness shews that magnis is· sarcastically
used, and hence the effect is dz'sparczgz'ng.
Similarly in ii 4, 11 ‘excelsum quendam
uidelicet' the irony is heightened. See
also ii 22, 52 ‘opinio est enim quaedam‚'
and note there.

quasi: as often, marks a translation,
cf. 2ο, 46 n.; 24, 57 n. ‘quasi consigna-
tas’; also 22, 52 ‘quasi uas aut receptacu-
lum'; 28, 68; ii4‚ 11 ; -ii 25, 61. What
the Greek expression was is uncertain.
Mr R. M. Henry suggests ἀποδήμησιν καὶ
μετεμψύχωσιν. But as it was very usual
sor Cic. to translate a single Greek word
by two Latin expressions, perhaps only
one of these Greek words is referred to.
Mr Henry adds that uitae is objective
gen.‚ μετεμψ. being=the entrance upon
(ἐν) an altered (μετ-) lise; and that the
antecedent to quae is uitcie3 the follow-
ing subjunctives being generic, ‘a change
to a life which in men and women of
renown is often the pathway to the sky,
while in meaner mortals it is confined
to earth and yet (tamen) persists un—
destroyed.⁷

migrationem: cf. i 41, 98, n.

[Ι used to think the readings unsound.

But some of the difficulties disappear
aster one remembers the ambiguity os the
word mors which bears different shades of
meaning, as (1) the actual moment os
severance from life, (2) the process that
leads up to the severance (‘(lying⁷), (3)
the state or condition resulting from the
severance, while (2) and (3) are some-
times combined as here in the application
of mors to migratio conzmulatt‘oque uitam]

migrationem commutationemque ui-
tae: this passage is difficult. Sff. takes
mors to be the subject of retineretur. We
should then have to take mors in its strict
sense with dux iu caelum soleret esse and
as: mortui with retineretur. Heiappears
to take uita as the subject; but to say
that uita byitself is dux in. caelum would
be to make a strange assertion. Or. and
others take the subject to be commutatio
nitae=uita commutata (abstract for con-
crete). The change in their lise ushers
the good into heaven—so many philo-
sophers held; cs. Plato's view that the
souls of the good passed to the outer rim
of the universe—while in the case of the
rest it, i.e. the uita commutata, i-e. the
animus a corpore seiunctus, is down in
the ground (? in Hades or haunting the
tomb) but still alive. Sff. and Kiih. read
ut permanerent tamen.

ξ 28. RomuluS...: a line from Ennius,
more correctly given by Servius on Aen.
vi 764 ‘ Romulus in caelo cum dis genitali-
bus aeuom degit.'

indeque perlapsus: ‘passing thence

to us.’ Cf. the story of Hercules and
Cacus, Livy i 7; Virg. Aen. viii
190 etc.

Oceanum: the Atlantic‚ where were
the Ἡρακλέους στῆλαι. Davies notes
that Hercules was worshipped at Gades
and that that place was regarded as the
end of the world, comparing (inter alia)
