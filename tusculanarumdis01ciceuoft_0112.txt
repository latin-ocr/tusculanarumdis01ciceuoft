opifices are included Protogenes, Apelles,
Phidias, and the elder Polyclitus.

For the two greatest works os Phidias,
his chryselephantine images of Olyinpian
Zeus and of Athene Παρθένος, see Sandys

the latter statue, here referred to, see
Sandys' full note on Or. 71, ²34·

sui similem. The distinction of the
old grammarians ‘sum similis tui mori-
bus3 similis tibi figura’ has long been
rejected. Madv. 011 Fin. v 5, 12 lays it
down that in Cic. and she older wrz'lers
the gen. is the rule and the dat. very rare
in the case of resemblance to living
beings, especially gods and men, aud
that both cases are used indifferently of
resemblance to things; that with Livy
the dative becomes more and more usual
even of resemblance to persons, and that
in Augustan poets (Virg. Hor. Ov.) the
gen. is scarcely found. Sff. thinks that
Madv. does not give the ground of the
distinction, and that patris sz'milz'sz‘the
very image of his fathe1·,'palri similis
‘like his father.⁷ Cf. 33, δ1 ‘facie uel
patris, uita omnium perditorum ita similis ’ς
ν 19, 56 ‘huuc illi duco simillimum.’ See
also Draeger H. S. 1 ἕ 197 p. 410; Reid
on Ac. ii 37, 118. For the reference cf.
Plut. Pericl. 31 τὴν πρὸς Ἀμαζόνας
μάχην ἐν τῇ ἀσπίδι ποιῶν αὑτοῦ τινα

cum inscribere nomen non liceret: so
Ktih. Sff. Ml. TS. nomen is not in the
MSS. It was restored by Ernesti, non—2,
i.e. nomen, having fallen out before non.
As sculptors often inscribed their names
upon their works, and Phidias himself
(cf. Pausanias v 10 p. 397) actually in-
scribed his name at the feet of his
Olympian Zeus, many have read cum
inscribere nomen licea-el. But Klotz,
quoted in liuh„ notes that many ancient
statues have been discovered in Paris to
contain the name of the sculptor carefully
concealed within them with a statement
that the artists were not allowed to
append their names openly. WVhence
Klotz conjectures that it rested with the
patron or authority, who ordered the
statue, to allow or forbid the inscription
of the name.

sua nomina inscribunt: cf. p. Areh.
11, 26 for the same thought.

ξ 35. omnesque qui ubique sunt:
loosely expressed and compressed for
omnes qni sunt, ubicumque smel. Before
Virg. and Livy absque only follows rela-
tive and interrogative words.

[ubique is related to uhi as ulique is to
uti, the que having a generalising force.
In Cic. the clause in which ubique occurs
always contains some part of essa]

arbitrabimur: the fut. is the same as
