liv JNTRODUCYJON

(d) Affisreadiug due to a theory as to tlte construction.

Copyists very commonly followed the sense of what they were
wridng, but only to an imperfect extent, that not being their main
business. Hence they were apt at times to write down the construction
which their mind was led to expect rather than that actually presented
to their eye.

1 5 37 apertae hostio for aperto ex ostio: apertae being brought into
construction with animae3 alto VBE instead of altae to agree with
ostio3 5 38 honore disciplina for lzouore disciplinae3 5 54 se ipsam for
se ipsa& 5 62 animus for am'mo (a symbol may here have contributed);
5 8ο dicantur for dicatur: but similar instances of plural for singular are
very common in the best Mss 3 something in the formation of the letter c
may have been mistaken for the flat mark that denoted the letter n.
5 94 bominis for homiui, to depend upon prudentia 3 5 102 morte for
mortem3 5 106 suspenso for suspensam (suspensd) to agree with somno3
5 107 sensu onmia for sensu omni to agree with saxa3 5 109 quae for
qzuzm to agree with tempestiua3 5 115 omnes for omni to agree with
amicos; 11 5 5 graecia for graeciae (abl. of separation or abl. abs.
imagined)3 this may also explain 5 10 mei or meae nimis, but see
explanatory note there3 5 11 ipsi sibi for ipse sibi3 5 16 dicere and
depellere for diceres and depellerere due to se taking the place of scilicet
and the constr. being supposed to be acc. and infinitive (a contractiori
of depellerere may have contributed). 5 22 taetram for taetra, to agree
with Lernam ; obtutum for obtutu made to agree with arbore7n3 in 5 24
the reading iecur seems due to an attempt to make that word the
subject3 531 dolere for dolore. 537 ac changed to ad before tibiam
when iter fell out3 5 39 luctum for luctus to agree with tantum3 540 in
nine, in montibus for in montibus, niueg 5 50 opprimite for opprimit3
5 51 suscitabitur for suscitabit, it not being seen that the reflexive is
carried on.

(e) flIisreading due to a word in tlte context.

1 5 5 Catonem sor Carbonem (Catonem occurs four words earlier) 3
5 81 similitudim’s for dissimilitudines (similitudo and similitudinem occur
in the two preceding lines) 3 5 82 quoniam for quod helped by quoniam
in the preceding line3 5 82 et sor sed, the following et being supposed
co-ordinate (the similarity of the words also contributed); 5 85 accidisset
for occidisset (accidere occurs four words earlier) 3 5 88 morte for malo, as
Ι conjecture (morte precedes four lines earlier); 5 105 ffi‘ctorem for
Hectora (Hectorem occurs three times in the next preceding lines);
5 116 rationis for orationis (rationes preceded); 11 5 60 deductus for
dedoctus (deduxisset occurs just below).
