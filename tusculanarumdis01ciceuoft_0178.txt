illness occurred in 50 Rs.. Cf. also
Att. viii 2, 3 ⁴ quotannis periculose
aegrotantis.’ For the imperfect some
recent editors have substituted aegrotasset,
but F. A. Wolf well observes ‘ aegrotantes
conualescere solent inter aegrotandum.⁷
(js. also 2, 4 note on ⁸ cum...recusaret.'

melius est factum : i.e. conualuit.

nimirum etiam Puteolani, ‘ you may
be sure the P. followed suit! Cicero
derides the eagerness of the inhabitants
of the smaller town to imitate those of
the larger one. For nimirum cf. 22,
52 n.

uolgo: cf. 46, 111 n„ ‘generally‚' i.e.
from nearly all the country towns.

publice. ‘in a representative capacity‚’
i.e. chosen deputations came.

fuerunt. . ‚gratulabantur ε for the tenses
cf. 2, 4 note on ‘Homer-unt, discebant.’

Graeculum, ‘thoroughly Greek⁷; both
this word and ineptum are disparaging,
cf. Or. i 51, 221 ‘aut illum ineptum et
Graeculum putent' ; and for the supposed
proneness of the Greeks to fall into ineptiae
Or. ii 4, 18. Cicero saw no ineptitude in
the case of similar rejoicings with regard
to himself on his return from exile, cf. in
Pison. 22, 51 ‘meus quidem reditus is fuit
ut a Brundusio usque Romam agmen per-
petuum totius Italiae uiderem. neque
enim regio fuit ulla...ex qua non publice
ad me uenerint gratulatum.’

For the constr. ineptum...negotium
see 26, 65 n. ⁶ non iusta causa.' [Cf. Fin.
fig 1 ‘audax negotium‚’ and for the ex-
pression Sen. Ep. 82 ξ 8 ‘ineptias Grae-
cas’ of Stoic paradoxes]

fortunatum, ‘a pieee of luck'3 an
instance of good fortune for Pompey, cf.
‘ miserum‚’ 5, 9.

cum socero: Pompey married, in 59
B.C.‚ Iulia daughter of Iulius Caesar.
She died in 54 B.C.

nudus, ‘unarmed‚’ ‘ defenceless‘; cf. ii
14, 33. So ’γυμνός often.

defleti: F.A.W. Sch. Bill. Or. Mo.
read deleti. Hei„ followed by TS. Ml.
and Kuh.. brackets and Schicne cuts out
:ill from mm liberi to possiderentur, on
the ground that both the thought and the
rhythm mark the death of Pompey as
the end of the period; that quisi obisset
naturally follows upon in ferrum el manus
incidisset: that the omission of essent
with defleti is not Ciceronian ; that
Pompey did not bewail the death of his
sons, as both were alive when he died,
and one actually survived Cicero; that
Cic. is dealing only with misfortunes
that besell Pompey personally ; and that
his property might have been seized by
others at the time when it was seized,
even though he had died much earlier.
deleti, though supported by several
editors, seems irreconcilable with the
fact that one son was alive when Cic.
wrote this passage. Mo. says ‘quasi
dixerit paene deleti': this would be the
rhetorical use of the plural. And even
though ‹le'lelz' were justified the other
objections quoted above from Hei. would
still apply. Of these Reiske’s conj.,
essent deleti, approved by Wesenberg,
only removes one. and Baiter’s expulsion
of non maeri defleti only removes two,
while the marginal gloss theory, which
would account for the presence of these
words. can also account for all down to
possicz'erenlur. Sff. gets rid of some
objections by taking defleti not as=de-
fleti essent but as a participle=depl0rati
