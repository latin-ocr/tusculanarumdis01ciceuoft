JNTRODUCTJON xix

after Caesar's death, while Cicero still had some hopes of a return to
constitutional governinent. The first book I take to have been written
before that event. The Calo Μαίον, as we have seen above, was written
before the second book De lh’usbnztimze, and no doubt also before the
first. 'l‘he statement contained in Cicero‘s letter of the 11th May,
quoted above, may seem to conflict with this view. But the reference
in that passage is not an ordinary reference to the sending of a new
work. It is very similar to the reference to the Tusculans discussed in
ἕ 3 above. Cicero must read and take to heart (to sortify him in that
dangerous time) his own work on old age (which has much in common
with his book on despising death), a work which he had dedicated
to Atticus. It would be very different if Cicero had merely written
misi tihi Catonem maiorem, ‘I herewith send you my new work, the
Cato Alaior, dedicated to you.⁷ The book may have been and pro-
bably was published four months earlier.

The De Νιιίιινα Deorum had not been published very long before
the De Diuiuaffmae, cf. the words paldo ante in i 5, 8 quoted above.
The question what length of time can be denoted by paulo ante is
precisely similar to the question what length of time can be denoted by
nuper in Tusc. Disp. v 11, 32 quoted on p. xvi. The difficulties
that would arise from making either expression denote much less or
much more than about three months are l think obvious. If we take
nuper to denote three months we should have Cicero writing the fifth
book of the Tusculan Disputations about the end of September, 45 ΗΟ,
a view which would agree with that of Dr O. E. Schmidt, who does not
indicate the process by which he has worked the question out‚—“Die
Ausarbeitung fand aber erst im August und September statt¹.'' Similarly,
if we take the first book De Dim'natione to have been finished by the end
of February, 44, and go back three months (paulo ante), we have the end
of November, 45, as the date of publication of the De Natura Deorum.

The results thus arrived at appear to me to give us approximate
dates for the composition and publication of the Tusculanae Disputa-
tiones, De Mztura Deorum, Cato Maior, and De Diuinatl'one completely

vconsistent with all the facts that bear upon the question.

(c) T lle dedication to Brutus.

Cicero dedicates this work to M. Junius Brutus. To Brutus Cicero
also dedicated the De Clarz's Oratoribus, paradoxa, and Orator, all in
46 B.C.‚ the De Finibus in 45, and the De Natura Deorum published
after the Tusculan Disputations.
