The best MSS regularly present the forms ii, iis (or lai, lzis), not
εἰ, eis. Eidem occurs once, 11 65. Cf. Fleek. p. 153 Bralnb. pp. 140,
32 3.

The best MSS have invariably the form cum not quom, yet the variant
cum R VG B P L for quo in 11 57 would seen] to have arisen fron] quo*
(z quem) for quo.

If we follow the MSS of the Tusculan Disputations there can be no
doubt as to spelling Accius, not Attius, cf. 11 13. Paulus and Gracchus
are the MS forms. Also cotidie, numquam, quamquam, quendam,
quandam, quicquam, quidquid, uolgo, uolnus, noll.

E is very commonly written for ς or ae and ς or ae for e. This error
I have generally passed over without notice in the critical notes. The
erroneous spellings caeteros in G 1 114 ancl qeterc's in B 11 43 are very
noticeable in MSS of such early dates.
