tmesis cf. p. Sest. 31, 68 ‘quod iudicium
cumque ⁹ ; Diu. ii 3, 7 ‘ qua re cumque' ;
Leg. ii 18, 46 ‘quod ml cumque legis
genus me disputatio nostra deduxerit)

VI. de uariis disciplinis : this clause
is attributive to philosophorum and coord-
with multorum. Or. compares πολλοὶ
καὶ καλοί. The words do not mean. as
Sch. supposed. that Cic. will first speak
of the folly and then of the systems of
many philosophers ; Or.⁷ besides pointing
out the weakness of such a proceeding,
notes that Cic. as a matter of fact does
not here deal with the systems of the
philosophers to whom he goes on to refer.
Bent. followed by Dav. conj. e for de, and
Cic. may have written e, but as de is used
in the same sense (cf. ‘de genere eodem '
iv 7, 16) there is no need to depart frorn
the MS reading.

disciplinis, ‘schools’ (αἱρέσεις Μο.),
cf. Ac. ii 3, 7 ; Fin. i4, 123 so often.

Aristippus of Cyrene, a pupil of
Socrates and founder of the Cyrenaic
school. He held pleasure to be the
chief good. For differences between his
view and that of Epicurus see Zeller,
Stoics, etc. c. xix p. 448.

ad hanc. ‘with reference to...’; i 4, 7
n. on ‘ ad id.'

hune post. : it is very doubtful whether
Cic. placed a monosyllabic prep. after
the case wh. it governed when that case
was a demonstrative accusative. qui
and lzz‘c are thus used, though rarely, at
the commencement of clauses, followed
by certain dissyllabic prepositions. K'uh.
notes that post does not elsewhere follow
its case, but thinks that the emendation
of Lamb. post hunc and that of Sff. lzunc

post lt'lzoslsus Hieronymus seculus are to
be rejected, as the order ‘quem ultra'
found in iv 17, 38 is also unexampled
either in Cic. or in other writers of the
same period.

Hieronymus: cf. Ac. ii 42, 13¹ ; Fin.
v 5, 14 ‘Hieronymum quem iam cur
Peripateticum appellem nescio ; summum
enim bonum exposuit uacuitatem doloris!
See also Zeller, Ph. d. Grieclzen 11 2
p. 925-

Zeno, of Citium in Cyprus, founder of
the Stoic school. The :stoics held that
virtue alone is good, vice alone evil;
that all things else are indifferent (media,
ὰδιάφορα); Zeller, Sloz'cs, elc. c. 10 pp.
216-83 and that things indifferent are
divided into three classes, things to be
preferred (προηγμένα, producta, praecipua,
praeposita), things to be rejected (ἀπο-
προηγμένα, remota, reiecta), and things
absolutely indifferent, καθάπαξ ἀδιάφορα 2
Zeller, Sloz‘cs, etc. c. xi pp. 264 foll.; Ac.
i 10, 36.

Aristonem Pyrrhonem: cf. Fin. ii 13,
43 and Madvig's n. ; Ac. ii 42, ¹30 and
Reid's n.; Zeller, Stoa-s, etc. c. 14 p. 366
for Aristo, and c. 22 pp. 492 foll. for
Pyrrho. Aristo denied that the ἀδιάφορα
were divisible into three classes, as held
by the Stoics.

Pyrrho, of Elis. founded the school
of the Sceptics‚ wh. a generat-ion or so
after his death became merged in the
New Academy.

malum mud quidem: cf. i 3, 6 n. on
