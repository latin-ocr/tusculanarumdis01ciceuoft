founded ἀριστᾶν (prandere) with ἀρισ-
τεύειν (fortitersaccre). but Cic. must have
been too familiar with the Greek lan-
guage and also with this story to commit
such a blunder, and, as Bent. observed,
he had also Tiro, skilled in both tongues,
to revise for him. Bent. at first con-
jectured prandete ait ι) J‘brte's Lacedae-
monii, and Ki'ih. notes that if he could
approve of any emendation he would
simply read prandete Lacedaemonii. But
Bentley found further inconsistencies and
(nolae ineditae p. ²3 published at the
end of Davies' edn. of 1805) decided
that the whole passage quid ille...mgr.·bant
was falsely inserted. The clause fuit
llaec gens sbrlt's...algebant interrupts the
construction as e quibus mzus would
refer⁷ and awkwardly refer, to llaec gens,
whereas it ought to refer to those who
fell at Thermopylae; and though this
objection might be removed by placing
this clause after pugnabimus its presence
would make the transition to uiros com-
memoro less clear and the statement is
inconsistent with ii 14, 34 ⁴ Spartae uero
pueri ad aram...' a passage which shews
that the institutions of Lycurgus retained
much vigour in Cicero’s day3 see also
v 27, 77. Nor would it suffice to cut
out this one clause only, for we should
still have the individual Leonidas in-
appropriately introduced in a passage
purporting to deal with the rank and
file. cf. legiones above. If the whole
extract be cut out e quibus unus is in
natural connexion and the argument
runs smoothly.

e quibus unus: Herod. vii 226 calls
him Διηνέκης, but makes the interlocutor
not a Persian but a Trachinian. Plut.

Apophth. Lacon. p. 225 attributes the
reply to Leonidas himself.

Perses: Cic. only used the nom. of
this word here and in Rep. i 27, 43
‘Cyrus ille Perses’; in Diu. i 46, 103
Persa is the name of a dog. He has
a similar form in T.D. v 32, 90 ‘ Scythes
Anacharsis) Cf. Mo. here and on Rep.

ξ 102. genueram: instances of this
word, as applied to females, are not rare
in post-Aug. Latin; a Ciceronian ex-
ample is N.D. ii 21, 129 ‘pisces‚ ut aiunt,
oua cum genuerunt, relinquunt.’

mortem...occumbere: most and best
MSS read morte, as do many early editions.
But Tischer (in App. to TS.) follows
Wes. in doubting the genuineness of the
reading here ‘as the abl. morte with
occumbere without accompanying adjective
only occurs here and in Livyi 7, 7, and
the letter m is often omitted even in the
best MSS of the Tusc. Disp.’ Lamb.
read morti, but this constr. is only poetic.
In occumbere mortem the ace. is an ex-
tension of the cognate accus-:occumbere
casum mortalem.

[I believe occumbere to be a gloss,
which has driven out the proper word
oppetere. In the only other passage where
occumbere is found in Ciceronian texts,
Att. iii 15, 4, it is due to mere con-

jecture—the second hand in Med.]

XLIII. estozssoncedo, i.e. ‘that may
be‚’ but these were a people specially
trained to hardship. Cic. anticipates a
possible objecfflon, which he proceeds to
meet by taking instances to which no such
objection can apply.
