compares amabunt ἓ 107 below, where
Dav. and Ern.‚ with 2 Oxford MSS, read
navabant.

Accius: Ellendt on Or. iii 7, 27 says
that in this word ‘libri...quod sciam,
ubique fere tt ignorant.' And this dictum
is fully confirmed so far as the MSS of
TJ). are concerned.

aliquando: 1, 1 n.

Accius et...Aehilles.: i.e. ‘Achilles in
fabula Acciana.' There is not evidence
to shew whether this line occurred in the
Achilles or in some other play of Accius.

enim uero: in O.L. an unaccented
vowel before two consonants very often
remaiued short where the later rule would
make it long by position. Cf. Sonnen-
schein on Plaut. Rudens Arg. l. 1.

Hectora abstuli: Ι have two reasons
for departing from the mss. which read
Hectorem: (ι) because Hectora was Ae-
cius' usual form, cf. Varro L. L. x 70 M.
‘ Accius haec in tragoediis largius a prisca
consuetudine mouere coepit et ad formas
Graecas uerborum magis reuocare, a quo
Valerius ait: Accius Hectorem nolet fa-
cere, Hectora malet⁷ quoted in Ribbeck
Frag. 1 p. 226. Cf. also Ribbeck's re-
marks on the quantity of Hectoris on
p. 63. (2) Because Cic. in writing
Hectora in the next line is evidently
repeating Accius’ word. The corruption
is due to the occurrence of Hectorem
three times in the preceding context.
Hectorem on the other hand is right in
Ennius, above.

Hectora traxisti: Hessos-a is the form
given here by the best and nearly all Mss.
Hectorem, Cic.'s usual form, is adopted
from a few inferior MSS by Kl. Seh. and
Mo„ but Cic. here repeats with a touch
of sarcasm Accius‘ exact word from the
previous line.

ξ 106. alius: the ghost of Deiphilus,
son of Iliona, daughter of Priam‚ and of
Polymnestor‚ King of Thrace, as ex·
plained by Or. Priam having sent his
son Polydorus to Iliona to be brought up
by her, Iliona brought him up as her
own son and brought up Deiphilus, her
son, as her brother. When the Greeks,
victorious at Troy, wished to extirpate
the race of Priam they called on Poly-
mnestor to put Polydorus to death, where-
upon he put Deiphilus to death believing
him to be Polydorus. Hyginus cix. Cf.
Heindorf on Hor. Sat. ii 3, 60 and
Bouhier on this passage. Cic. often
refers to this scene, cf. Ac. ii 27, 88;
Sest. 59, 126.

sinat: subj. of quality, cf. Ter. Hec.
213 ‘tu sola exorere quae perturbes haec
tua inpudentia'; p. r. Deiot. 1 3 ‘ex-
ortus est seruus qui eum accuset
solutus.’

Mater te appeuo...: for the source
of these lines cf. Ribbeck vol. Ι, p. 100
and Porphyrion on Horace Sat. ii 3, 60.
As usually printed the lines are iambic
octonarii, but Cicero ξ 107 below calls
them septenarii. K'uh. Hei. TS. suppose
that Cic. made a mistake as to the metre ;
