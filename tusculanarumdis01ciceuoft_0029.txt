There are fewer and less clear indications of the source from which
Cicero drew his material for the second book. The book contains
much pure Stoicism. Heine¹ cites the following instancesz—-g' 31
the doctrine that without prudentia no virtue is conceivable‚ and
that the four cardinal virtues enjoin the endurance of pain3 g 32 that
virtue cannot be lost, and that the possession of one virtue implies the
possession of all virtues3 ,ξ 43 the definition of virtue as recta animi
adfecti03 §47 the expression quae conixa per se el progressa longius fil
perfecta uirtus, this being the doctrine of προκοπή; ,ξ 51 the statement
that there is no known example of the ideal wise man; ξ 63 the same
distinction between petfi’cta m'rlus and the opinio honestatis of the un-
philosophic multitude which we find in Off. iii ἓ 17. Hence a pure
Stoic source has been thought of. Κ111111012 says that Chrysippus
seems to have been chiefly followed by Cicero in the first four
books. But Chrysippus could not have written ξ 47 est enim animus iu
parles tributus duas quarum altera rationis est parll'aps, altera expers
(see explan. n. ad locum), and the criticism of Stoic syllogism could not
come from him. Hence Hirzel and Heine reject Chrysippus. Hirzel³
thinks Philo the source for Book 11 as well as for Book 1. Heine
objects that if Philo had employed such Stoic arguments as we find
in Book 11, and in the first part of Book 1, his contemporaries
would have set him down as a Stoic and not as an Academic.

There is more to be said in favour of Panaetius or Posidonius as
source. Panaetius wrote a letter to Tubero de dolore patiendffi.
Zietschmann⁵ thought this Cicero's source. And Cicero derived his
material for de Officiis i—ii from Panaetius. But there are no facts
to connect Panaetius with the second book of the Tusculans except
the letter above referred to. Cicero was also beholden to Posidonius
for material. He had a book of Posidonius before him when writing
the third book de Officiis⁶ and probably drew more from it than the
statement in de Officiis iii 2, 8 would lead us to suppose. His probable
obligation to Posidonius in the first book of the Tusculans has been
already dealt with. Bake⁷ gives good reason for believing that Cicero
drew upon the Προτρεπτικοί of Posidonius for his Hortensius. The
division of the soul into a rational and irrational part in g 47 is in
