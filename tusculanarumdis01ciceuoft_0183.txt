ble. Some second-rate MSS read con- finding his soldiers disturbed by a rumour

currerunt, others and some early editions
read cucurrerim& some early editions
cucurrere. The compound is to be
preferred on its own merits as well as
on the authority of the Mss. con-
denotes collision with the enemy, as
often in this word, not vehemence or
convergence in attacking, as some editors
have supposed.

si timeretur...concidisset: for the
tense cf. 12, 27 n. on ‘nisi haereret.‘

L. Brutus: cf. Livy ii 6.

Decius: the reference in pater is to
the sight at Veseris 340 B.C. ; in filius to
Sentinum 295 B.C.; and in nepos to
Asculum 279 B.c. Mommsen RH. 1
366 n. doubts the sels-immolation of the
father, but, though he shews that the
narrative of the first Samnite-Latin war
of the Romans bristles with absurdities,
he puts forward no convincing argument
on this particular point; for it was a
common belief among earlier warriors
that one man by sacrificing his own life
could in'volve in his destruction that of
the hostile army, and the renown ac-
quired by a father by such an act would
strongly stimulate his son to repeat
the act.

For the practice of self-immolation and
its meaning see Preller, leem. Myth.
466—9; Mayor on Juv. viii 257 and further
references there.

With regard to the grandson Cic.
repeats in Fin. ii 19, 61 the assertion
here made ‘seque...tertiam uictimam rei
publicae praebuisset.’ But in Off. iii 4,
16; Cato M. 20, 753 Diu. i. 24, 513
Paradoxa 12 he only refers to two Decii,
and Zonaras Ann. viii 5 definitely asserts
that before the battle of Asculum Pyrrhus,

that Decius was preparing to imitate his
father and grandfather, ascertained the
garb worn by those who devoted them-
selves in battle, forbade his men to slay
anyone so arrayed, and sent word to
Decius that if he made the attempt he
would be taken alive and put to death
by torture; whereupon the consuls replied
that they had no need to have recourse to
any such plan. Zonaras also indicates
that both consuls survived the battle.
Moreover, the fact that the battle resulted
in victory for Pyrrhus (cf. Mommsen Ι
414) shews that the devotion if historic
was ineffective. ·

Scipiones: Publius, the father, and
Gneius the uncle of Scipio Africanus
Maior. These two commanders fell in
Spain in 212—211 B.C.‚ (ineius a few days
later than Publius. L. Aemilius Paulus
consul in 216 ΒΕ. and Cn. Servilius Ge-
minus consul in 217 ΒΕ. sell at Cannae.
Μ. claudius Marcellus, who took Syra-
cuse in 212 B.C.‚ fell in a skirmish near

' Venusia in 208 B.C.

Litana: the best MSS have Latina.
The emendation «which Mo. ascribes to
Billerbeck, Or. and Schiche to Lindemann,
Kiih. to Menkius) is rendered certain by
Livy xxiii 24, 7 ‘silua erat uasta (Litanam
Galli uocabant)...ibi Postumius (i.e. con-
sul L. Postumius Albinus) omni ui, ne
caperetur, dimicans occubuit)

Lucani: Or. conjectured and Mo. ac-
cepted Lucania thinking Lucani a copy-
ist’s substitution for Lucania. after Litana
had been corrupted into Latini.

[Lucaniz Wolfflin in AJ—clz. ΧΠ 332
points to the absence of Lucania at
this time (Ι had noticed it). He says it
no more existed than Bruttium or
