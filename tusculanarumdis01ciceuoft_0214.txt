sententia. K'uh. holds that -em was the
-usual acc. ending for such nouns in Latin
writers of the golden age but that -a
sometimes occurs3 and that -am belongs
to writers subsequent totthat age.

tropaei in the sense of uictoriae be-
longs rather to poetry. The same use
occurs in Corn. Nep. Themist. 5, 3
‘ Marathonio.. ,tropaeo.’

memoriam: obruet is carried on but
no longer with Neptunus as subject.
obliuio would be the natural subject,
and this Reiske wished to insert after
quam. l fail to see any idea in [Veptmms
which can be carried on as subject here.
The sentence seems too short to admit of
the theory that Cic. wrote quam (sc.
obruet) Sal. trop. memoriam meaning to
write quam obruetlsr Sal. trop. memoria.
If obruetur fell out after quam (or aster
tropaei) a copyist would probably bring
memoria into construction by changing it
into maneriam.

Boeotia: may be adj. and may be
added, as K'uh. and ΤΞ. note, because
there were towns called Λεῦκτρα (Λεῦκ-
τρον) ’111 Arcadia and Laconia as well as
in Boeotia. The instructive addition
would then be parallel to 38, 92 ‘Latmo
...qui est mons Cariae,' where see note.
There is also a sair sense in ⁶ sooner will

Boeotian Leuctra be removed than the
glory of Leuctra's right) The expression,
however, hardly seems natural and, when
the miraculous removal of a substantial
portion of the earth⁷s crust is referred to,
the place whence or the place whither is
usually indicated. I therefore believe
that e has fallen out after priusque and
that the meaning is ‘ sooner will Leuctra
be removed from Boeotia than the glory
of Leuctra's rights It may also be noted
that in the examples in the immediate
context an object (person or country) is
specified to which the glory attaches. V2
inserts e and O1 has a.

[I have also conjectured e Boeolia ; but
possibly Boeoz‘zs. Leuctra Boeotia lellen-
tur is hardly in line with Leg. Agr. 1
ἕ 19 ‘Capua...sustulerunt³; or Verr. 2,
2, 51 ¹ Syracusis Marcellia tolluntur.' In
favour of e might be quoted Verr. 2, 2, 4
‘urbem ex sociorum insula tollendam';
2, 2, 91 ‘urbem ex Italia pulcherrimam
non sustulerimus]

Calatinum: 7, 13 11.

duo: for duo as acc. Brutus refers to
Charisius i, p. 101 who quotes Aen. xii
(more correctly xi 285) ‘si duo praeterea
tales Idaea tulisset’ and Attius, Epinausi-
mache' (Ribbeck 1 p. 178, l. 52¹)· See
also Neue Formenlehre, ed. 3, vol. 11
pp. 279 sq. [Ι believe Cic. wrote duos,
ambos, exclusively]

arripuerit: the word suggests eager-
