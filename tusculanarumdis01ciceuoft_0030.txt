xxvi INTRODUCTJON

harmony with what we know of the views held by Posidonius. See
explanatory note there. The criticisms of Stoic extreme views con-
tained in Book ii of the Tusculans seem also possible to Posidonius,
while it is (lifficult to think of any other philosopher who could have
been at once the author of these criticisms and of the Stoic utterances
cited above.

Much of the argument employed in Book 1 to shew that death is to
be despised also serves to prove that pain is to be endured. Cicero,
having in consequence less material available for Book ΙΙ, uses more
padding here than in Book 1. Thus the introduction ξξ 1—13 is longer.
He quotes frequently from Latin poets and translates at considerable
length from Greek poets. He indulges in ξ 35 in fallacious criticism of
the Greek language, de sno. He illustrates from the XII Tables, and
introduces several Roman examples. - ”

ΟΝ THE MSS or THE TUSCULAN DISPUTATIONS.

(a) Their classz'ficcztion.

All MSS of the Tusculan Disputations are descended from an arche-
type which cannot have been later than the 6th or 7th century A.D., and
may have been much earlier.

From this archetype two groups of MSS are derived: group α com-
prising all the best MSS now extant along with others of less value3
group β comprising the source of the lost MS from which the bulk of
the corrections in V, as well as several MSS of the second and third class,
are derived.

Besides these two groups there are several MSS, including O r—6 10
12 which have been copied from MSS that had, by correction or eclectic
compilation, received readings from both groups.

The archetype of group α was an uncial MS belonging probably to
the 7th or perhaps to the 6th century A.D. The errors presented by the
MSS of this group have to a large extent arisen from the niisreading
of symbols and contractions3 there was less fixity with regard to the
use of these in the 6th and 7th centuries than at a later date, while
earlier they were much more sparingly used.

The archetype of group β was probably not much earlier than that
of group α. V2 presents a remarkable number of readings which are
