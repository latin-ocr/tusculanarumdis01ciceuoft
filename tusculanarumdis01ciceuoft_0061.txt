of wailing for the dead serves to shew that the dead are believed to he
conscious of their loss, Q 30. (c) The best men work and ‹Jare sor
posterity‚ QQ 31-35.

ΙΙ. philosophie theory also supports the doctrine of immortality.

If the soul exists after death, the question naturally arises where
does it reside and what is it like? Q36. The sanic question arose out
of the question whether death is an evil or not, Q 18. Various vicws
have been set forth in QQ 18--24‚ the conclusion led up to thcre being
that whether the soul exist after death, or not, death is no evil. Here
in QQ 36—52 the point to be proved is that the soul is immortal, and
various views of philosophers as to what the soul is and where it resides
are touched upon or set forth as leading up to that conclusion.

The idea of the lustri is merely an unphilosophic deduction from
the fact that the body falls to the ground and is buried under the
ground, Q36. The unphilosophic multitude cannot think os the soul
as apart from the body, Q 37. This idea was first grasped by phil‹›sopher5‚
§38-

Pherecydes seems to be the first recorded to have asserted the
doctrine: his pupil Pythagoras established it3 Plato gave reasons
for it, QQ 38—9. The soul when separated from the body goes aloft
and rises to a point where a fiery compound is formed by the blending
of the rarer air with the modified heat of the sun, QQ 40—49.

Those who deny the immortality of the soul do so because they are
unable to conceive of or imagine the soul apart from the body. There
is no difficulty in doing this unless we are unable to imagine anything
that we have never seen. The difficulty is rather to imagine the soul
in the body. QQ 50—52.

It is not, however, necessary to the establishment of the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul that we should form a mental conception
of the soul or an opinion (Q 53) as to where itis situated3 but Cicero
returns to these points in QQ 67 and 70.

Arguments for the immortality of the soul :—

1. That which is sels-moving never had a beginning and will
never have an end3 the soul is self-moving and therefore immortal.
ἑὲ 53-55·

2. Several arguments not very clearly distinguished or expressed‚
QQ 56—71‚ see Excursus ll on 1 24, 56 foll.

(a) The argument from the indivisible and simple nature
of the soul. This argument is begun in nam sanguinem, bilem...,
Q 56, but lost sight of there owing to another argument presenting itself
to Cicero’s mind, and ultimately stated in Q 71—that which has no
component parts cannot be broken up.
