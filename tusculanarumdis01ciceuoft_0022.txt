xviii INTRODUCTION

was fortified by the first book of the Tusculan Disputations (de con-
temnenda morte), i.e. that he learnt from Cicero himself that, if the
worst came to the worst, death was to be despised. This remark
could be made only when the occasion for making it arose, whether
the book had been recently received or long before.

4. (α) In De Diu. i 5, 8 Quintus says perlegi tuum paullo (mle
tertium de nalum deornm.

(b) In De Dm. ii 9, 22 Caesar is referred to as dead.

(c) In De Dm. ii 2, 7 Cicero uses the expression nunc, quoniam
de re publica consuli coepti sumus.

(d) The De Fato was written after the death of Caesar, and
probably not long after that event, cf. g 2 above. It probably followed
immediately upon the De Dimbmtiozze, cf. ἓ 2.

(c) On the 1 1th May, 44 B.C.‚ Cicero writes legendus milzi saepius
est Calo Maior ad le missus&

(f) On the 31‘d July Cicero promises to send the De Gloria
to Atticus, and he sends it on the 11th2.

(g) The Laelius was written before the De Officiis&

(le) The first two books De Officiis were written by the 5th
Nov. 44 B.C.4

It is to be noted that the reference to Caesar as dead and the
expression nnnc, quoniam de ν. p. consuli coepta· sumus both occur in
the second book De Diuinatione. That book was, therefore, written
aster the death of Caesan The words de ν. p. consuli coepti sumus
would seem to fit the few weeks that followed the death of Caesar,
15th March to 11th April, 44 (the senate being prorogued on the latter
date).

Cicero was in or near Rome during those weeks and could attend
the senate, and for a time he had expectations of a return to consti-
tutional government. They would not apply to a later date as he
was presently undeceived and writes to Atticus the words referred to
in ,ξ 3 above, with reference to the danger of speaking freely.

Ι cannot see how the words in question could point to the end
of September or beginning of October, 44, as they are taken to do by
Prof. Reid in an obiter dz'ctzmz in his introduction to the Cato Maior,
Ι). 9 note, for, besides other considerations, the De Gloria was sent to
Atticus on the rith July‚ and as it is not mentioned in the De
De'm'mztione ii 1, 2—4 it is reasonable to infer that it had not been
written when that work was published.

I take the second book De Dim'natione to have been written very soon
