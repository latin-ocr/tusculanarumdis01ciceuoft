MSS tractari coepissent. Kiihner seems
right in reading tractari coepta sunl (aster
Keil and Madvig), noting that COEPTA-
SUNT might easily pass into COEPISSENT,
and in finding the subjunctive unnatural
even on the theory of attraction to the
following didicissent. Cicero constantly
uses the passive form (coeptus ηψπ) with
the passive infin. and the active form
withI the active infin. fier',2 not being
a true passive in origin, is exceptional‚
and is joined with the active form
(caepz).

For Livy’s use see Kuhnast,L1vzan-
zsclzc Syntax, p. ‘251 [Riemami, Euam,
p. 161 sq.]; and sor that of Tacitus see
Draeger, Synl. des Tacilus, p. 9; see
also Draeger Hist. Synt- 1l pp. 137—140,
ἕ 2.

reason; qui=cum lzz'. Sections 27——29
have dealt with the opinion of omnis
antiquitas. It is possible that a word has
fallen out after sed, e.g. ueteres or lzz'.
The line of thought, which is here some-
what involved, is thus best explained,
after Heine———‘Yet the ancients, being
unacquainted with philosophie principles,
had only a hazy belief in this matter,
based upon obvious phenomena‚ and
often (lue even to the impressions pro-
duced by dreams.'

rationes, ‘the underlying principles.’

contains a

§ 30. The argument in this section is,
‘just as general consent is held to prove
the existence of the gods, so it should
prove the immortality of the soul.' Cf.
16, 36 ‘sed ut deos 6556 natura opinamur

,sic permanere animos arbitramur con-
sensu nationum omnium.²

We have hele a parenthesis and an
anacolouthon. The parenthesis (multi
...pulcnzda est) is inserted to meet a
possible objection‚ viz.—all believe in the
gods, it is true, but why do they not
agree in their belief? The anacolouthon
consists 111 this—to the ut-clause (ut
porro...) an ita clause should correspond,
but the insertion of a parenthesis often
leads, as here, to the omission of the
second limb of the sentence, often to its
modification. Kiih. holds that ancient
writers of dialogues (e.g. Plato, Cicero)
did not fall into such constructions
through negligence, but purposely sought
to imitate in them the natural turns of
conversation.

tam sit inmanis: reported reason.
For the custom of separating lam quam
tantus quantus from the words they
qualify by some small word, a preposition
or sit or the like, see Reid on Ac. ii 26,
83 quam in paruo.

inbuerit: sor inbuere of first impres-
sions cf. Tac. Hist. v 5 ‘nec quicquam
prius inbuuntur quarn contemnere deos,'
also 7, 13 n.

deorum opinio: persuasio de deis.
Gen. of indirect object.
