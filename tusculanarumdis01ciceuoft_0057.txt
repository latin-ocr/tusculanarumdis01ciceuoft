And a sor ta.

1 ,ξ 45 patriam for patritam.

Not dissimilar is tic sor te.

1 ,ξ 82 Democritt'ct' for Democritea

And ct sor t.

i ὲ 110 expectatur for expetatum 11 §19 expectens for expetens.
E sometimes occupies more space than a single letter usually
occupies, and the abbreviation ὢν for et is sometimes rather like cet.

α for o.
ιι ξ 46 utar for utor.

u for o.

11 §30 fortunae for fortunae 3 ,ξ 52 conscius for conscios 3 {60 deductus
for dedoctus.

o for u.

11 ξ 2 3 soboles for suboles; 1 §7 commotus for cum motusg 11 §45 qui-
cumplures for qui complure53 ,ξ 41 consolatus for consulatus. Here and in
furtunae for fortunae, and in some other instances‚ the copyist seems to
have been misled by looking forward to the vowel of the following
syllable. In consolatus the first 0 has probably brought in the second o.
When he wrote utar for utor he may have expected a future, and conscius
for conscios may have been due rather to an idea of the construction than
to any resemblance of the o to u. Deductus took the place of dedoctus
as being the more familiar word and being suggested by the context.

ae for e and e for oe.

ae was very commonly written ς and often e, hence confusion arose.
1 ξ 93 quaerendum for querendmn3 11 g 39 lzaectoris or llaec toris for
