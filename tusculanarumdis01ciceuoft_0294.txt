maiorem clamorem (cs. TS.); the use is
therefore an extension of that of the
cognate acc., and comes under the same
head as i 41, 99 ‘quod suscenseam.’ For
parallels (chiefly found in poetiy) cf.
Roby ξ 1096; Κ1111. Gram. ΙΙ pp. 21 1-1.

an imitation of the Greek, but Draeg er

origin and not adopted from the Greek,

influence.’ [Ι think the only 116611511ῖί1 65
of this sort in Cic. are with words
relating to sound (sonare, canere).]

eici uocem: elici of MSS.‚ though
retained by Dav. (ed. 3) Kl. Tr. Sff.‚ is
impossible here, where the ref. 15 obviously
to the expulsion of vocal sounds (cf. also
szmdere here). The case is different
where A draws utterance (e-g. indignant
protest) from B, a meaning wh. could
apply in p. Cael. 24, 60 ‘ne quam 11066111
eliciat ⁷ (Lall. Or.); and 111 Lucr. iii 57,
where Duff 15 probably right in retaining
eliciuntur against Lach. and Munro. But
in Lucr. iii 497 ‘eiciuntur’ and in iv 945

omnibus ungulis: Lamb., on the
ground that ungulae does not apply to
the human nails, proposed ²⁰²5 r'zcz ·'‚ulzs
wh. Bent.app1·ovech Dav. quotes in-
stances to shew that ungulae can be used
of the human nails, but his instances from
Isidorus and Rufinus do not prove the
usage to be classicam and in Plaut. Pseud.
ii 2, 47 and iii 2. 63 there is an obvious
metaphor from the talons of a bird of
prey. But the use here also is meta-
phorical: the expression has become
proverbial as is shewn hy ut dicitur (cf.
§58 ‘toto pectore, ut dicitur‚’ and Reid
on Ac. i ἕ 18) and the metaphor 15
derived, as seen hy Or.‚ from the action
of horses striking the front edge of their
hoofs hard into the ground in drawing
a load up a steep place. With this
action loto corpore is also in harmony.

adseruiunt: this word does not occur
elsewhere. inseruire is usual in this
sense. Klotz rightly finds 111 the prefix
the notion of side-help. Trans. ‘supple-
ment.⁷

§57. M. Antonium: for an account
of this man, including a notice of the
lex Varia, see Wilkins, Introd. to de
Oratore 1 pp. 13—16. The lex Varia,
passed in 91 B.C.‚ directed the appoint—
ment of a special commission to try de
maiestase those quorum dolo malo socii ad
arma ire coacti essent. For this law see
Mommsen li’. H. ΙΙΙ 236—7 (E. T.).
Antonius was acquitted and, later on,
Varius was himself condemned under his
own law.
