ut sciatur (zat hoc sciatur sc. quid sit
carere) follows upon excutiendum est quid

‘griindlich.’—‘ the meaning of 1116 word
carere must be thorouglzly examined.'

‘ aut aliquis latet error.’ So melus often
= ‘ cause of fear.'

malum: this passage in all iuss follows
the words facile patiare 7 lines lower
down⁷ and merle not malo is read by all
except R6 and (in margin) V6. Orelli
who adopted malo asserts that Bernensis
reads malo, but he was misinformed by
Usteri the Berne professor who supplied
him with the readings of that MS. The
fact that two early editions (S E) read ca—
rere z'n malo may be taken as probably
shewing that some Renaissance scholar
saw that malo was required. J. Μ. Brutus
in his edition reads carere enim malo id
non dicitur, but he does not state the read-
ing of Gr. All emendations hitherto put
forward have been unsatisfactory. Madv.
conjectured and Tr. adopted (probante
Wes.) malo carere in Μανία Keil iam

carere3 R. Enger. carere ea ui (ca uz'
being supposed to lurk in enim) ; Sff. ea
re carere in morte (ea re and ea uz'
meaning ‘in the latter sense of the word'
just as H. Sauppe's z'ta). But to all these
I object that the context sails not only to
carry on the argument but even to yield
any definite sense. Bentley confessed
that he did not understand the words
carere z'n morte...malum‚ and O. Heine

proposed to cut them out, and so obtained
a tolerable sense.

But how then did they corne into the
Mss? I believe that they are merely out
of place and that they should follow the
words erroris in uerbo. An early copyist
missed this clause beginning with carere
and went on to the clause beginning with
carere igilur lzoc szgrngficat. When he
had written down tosacile patiare he dis-
covered the omission and inserted the
clause beginning with carere in malo, out
of its proper place. carere in malo, not
carere in morte, though the latter is the
MS reading. At some time subsequent
to the error os transposition malo was
altered to morte by an interpolator or
owing to the act os a glossator, who
thought the change demanded by the
words secl ne uiuus quidem and al in
ntorum, following. See Argument of
Bk I, Introd. ξ 4, where the line of
thought is worked out and a translation
with some explanatory notes added.

With regard to the MSS it need not
excite surprise thatga sentence should
have got out of its proper place in all
MSS. Cf. the remarks upon ‘ Transposi-
tion,’ Intr0d.§ 3 c ii.

uelis: for the subj. cf. habeas and

tamquam: a rarer use of tamquam: '
ut or quem ad modum: cf. 10, 20 ‘tam-
quam in cantu sonos'3 iii 10, 23-

tamquam in febri: cf. Fam. xvi 15
‘mihi nuntiauit te plane febri carere.'

dicitur enim, ‘for carere is used in
another sense when.. ,' i.e. another sense
than that of egere eo quad habere uelis,
febri carere being a particular instance
of this use.
