sues: not even the pig (proverbially
the most stupid os animals and a famous
sleeper) would wish that, so far from
man himself (of whom mental activity is
the distinctive characteristic) wishing it.
The contrast is somewhat awkwardly
expressed by Cic„ as man in general
must be supplied by inferenee from quis-
quam ‘any one at all.’ To avoid this
many editors (TS. Kl. Bai. Ml. Hei.
Schiche) have adopted Keil's conjecture
sui which is also the reading of J. But
there does not seem sufficient reason for
departing from the MSS. Moreover in
many cases a man’s relations would
prefer having him with them asleep‚
(say) from his 60th to 1115 90111 year, to
burying him in his 60th year.

non modo ipse: cf. Diu. ii 55, 113
‘ne mediocri quidem cuiquam, non
modo prudenti probata sunt ’ 3 Livy xxv
15, 2 *ne Tarentum quidem non modo

usual form os expression would be non

The argument seems 10 tue—Some, in
order to make death seem less terrible,
represent it as a perpetual sleep: but a
perpetual sleep would be no better than
1163111, 511166 both states are equally
marked by absence of consciousness.
Even a sleep like that of Endymion
is unrelieved by any pleasure since there
15 3 10131 absence of consciousness. You
do not sear sleep; there is then no reason
to sear death. Cf. Fin. v 20, 55 ‘itaque
ne 51 iucundissimis quidem nos somniis
usuros putemus, Endymionis somnum
nobis uelimus dari, idque 51 36611131,

laboret: subj. of reported thought.
For the expression cf. Virg. Geo. ii 478
‘defectus solis uarios lunaeque labores.’
The expression seems to have come
down from the time when an eclipse was
