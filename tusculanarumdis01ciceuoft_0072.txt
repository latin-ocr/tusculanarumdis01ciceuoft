docti, much more might the Gr. models
be so styled. The subj. is due to cum
causal.

si quidem. ‘at all events if,’ almost
=‘since.' These words are osten thus
used in putting forward, as ground for
a preceding statement, something as-
sumed to be admitted as a fact. Cf.
Brutus 10, 40 ‘ (Homeri) etsi incerta sunt
tempora, tamen annis multis suit ante
Romulum ; si quidem non infra Lycurgum
fuit’3 p. Mur. 11, 24.

[Archilochus: N epos, in Gell. xvii 21,
says in time of Tullus Hostilius]

ann-is: abl. of measure (instrumental):
cf. Robyg 1204, and note. Δ

fere: to mark an approximation, be-
cause the nearest round number is taken.

DX: strictly 514 years, srom 754 to
240 B.C.‚ the year of the consulship of
C. Claudius Cento and M. Sempronius
Tuditanus: see Brut. 18, 72, quoted be-
low, and Cato M. 14, 50.

lam also occurs several times in prologues
of Terence.

qui fuit maior natu quam Plautus et
Naeuius. If these words are sound qui
must refer to Liuius, not to Ennius, but
though Or. and (following VVes. Em. 11,
p. 1) Sff. thought this order of words
justified, where there could be no am-
bigusty, by the notoriety of the fact that
Ennius was later than Plautus and Nae-

uius, this seems impossible. In 31, 75
the reference in the pronoun is more
obvious. Rath placed this clause imme-
diately aster Liuius. Dav. thinks that
Cic. has committed a σφάλμα μνημονι-
κόν, 1)111 111 Brut. IS, 73, written two
years earlier, Cic. shews that he knows
that Ennius was junior to Plautus and
Naeuius. Kfih. is pretty certainly right
in holding that the words qltz'...Nae7tius
are due to a glossator, who, remembering
the passage in the Brutus, copied these
words into the margin in order to fix
Liuius' period, and that from the margin
they got into the text. Tr. Sch. Ts.

bracket. FAW. ejected el Naeuius
(omitted in some MSS) and bracketed
the rest. Ennius lived 239—169 ΗΕ.
Plautus died in 184 B.C.‚ and Cic. Cato
M. 14, 50 refers to the Pseudolus (acted
191 B.C.)asa work ofhis old age. Naeuius
died at an advanced age in 202 B.C.;
he is said to have served in the first Punic
war, upon which he wrote. Naeuius was
therefore certainly, and Plautus probably,
earlier than Ennius. Ter. And. prol. 18
probably gives the historical order Nae-
uz'mn‚ Plautum, Ennium.

ΙΙ. recepti: because the earliest poets
were not Roman citizens. Liuius was a
Greek from Tarentum, Naeuius was from
Campania, Plautus from Umbria, Ennius
from Calabria.

quamquam est. in: Sff. followed by
TS. inserted enim, against the Mss and
wrongly. The quamquam clause intro-
duces a fact apparently inconsistent with
the statement just made; this fact is
explained away by the tamen clause.
Many editors, and recently TS., have
merely a comma after uirtutibus; wrongly,
