de Anaxarcho : Anaxarchus of Abdera
was a contemporary of Alexander the
Great‚ whom he accompanied to Asia.
After the death of Alexander Anaxarchus
being shipwrecked fell into the hands of
Nicocreon of Cyprus, who had him
pounded to death in a mortar. Accord-
ing to Diog. L. ix. 10, 58 A. had earlier
given offence to N. by suggesting to
Alexander that a certain banquet would
be more complete if the table were
adorned with the head of a certain satrap,
viZ. Nicocreon. In our passage most
MSS give the tyrant's name as Timocreon,
but the name Nicocreon is supported by
Diog. L. as aboveg Val. Max. iii 3. 4;
Nemesius de Nat. Hom. c. 301). ²33 ed.

·25, accompanied Alexander the Great
from Taxila westwards and, falling ill
aster he had lived without any ailment
73 years, burnt himself on a pyre in
presence of the Macedonian army (Diod.
xvii 107). At a moment when the sun
shone full upon him he saluted it and
gave the signal to kindle the pyre (Aelian
V. H. v 6). Athenaeus x 437 a also
refers to his death as having been des-
cribed by Chares of Mytilene in his
history of Alexander. Strabo xv 4 p. 686
and Plut. Alex. 69 mention his death and
also the similar death of another Ἰνδὸς
σοφιστής at Athens in the time of Augus-
tus. Cf. also Cic. Diu. i 23, 47; Arrian
Anab. vii ²3 Val. Max. i 8, 10. Plut.
Alex. 65 says that his real name was
Sphines and that he was called Κάλᾶνος
because he said καλέ instead of χαῖρε in
saluting people.
