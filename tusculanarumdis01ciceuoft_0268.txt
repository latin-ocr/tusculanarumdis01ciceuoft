‘militat in siluis catulus.' If we retain
militia we must take it in the sense of
military training, ‘drill,⁷ and refer it to
the rigorous training to which the women
as well 35 1116 111611 31 Sparta were sub-
jected. It must be admitted that 311
exact parallel to this use has not been
put forward. But Bouhier's labor mils-

and Schiche, besides departing from the
MSS involves giving the word either this
meaning or that of ‘lmnting’ The
emendation of Sff. militiae el studio is
at first sight plausible, for the use would
be obviously metaphorical‚ but strlz'lifas
baa-hara could not be said mzliliac csse
to the women with whom these are con-
trasted, and militiae does not seem to
occur elsewhere as a predicative dative.
Roby 11 introd. p. xlviii gives no in-
stance.

fertilitas: this word has proved very
troublesome, If sound, it must have the
meaning of wohvretrvc'a,sccltmlt'las being
the more usual word in this sense. The
poet need not imply that Spartan women
have few children or none3 he merely
says that their mind is centred not upon
children but upon the things mentioned
111 1116 previous line. while women ofother
nations are devoted to indoor life, their
householtls, and their children.

Nissen thought that fi‘rtililas lam-hara
meant (luxurious) ‘products of foreign
(extra-Spartan) lands,' but 11115 would be
much more obscurely expressed than the
meaning I have suggested above nor would
the contrast be very complete or pointed.
facililas, found in a few late and inferior
MSS, was favoured byErn. in the sense of

proposed fizlilslas barbara. A good
suggestion is sent to me by Dr Reid, who

thinks that militia has been corrupted ,

from mollitia by the influenceof milzliam
below and that fertilitas and mollitia
have iuterchanged places. The conjec-
tures of other scholars 566111 irreconcilable
with the MS reading.

barbara: must refer to non-Greeks.
Or. refers to the 17 children of Hecuba,
50 of Danaus, 50 of Aegyptus.

XVI. ξ 37. militiam uero: Cic. in-
tended to write something like militiam
uero quantum laborem (za-'feras‘ uidem but,
as militia implies eremitas, an argument
from the etymology of urendus occurring
to him interrupted the construction. Had
the sentence taken its original course we
should have had an instance of the same
attraction asin 1 24, 5611„ ‘sanguinem„..’
As it 15 wc have that attraction and an
anacolouthon as well.

Emendations are unnecessary and un-
satisfactory. J. F. Gronovius* militiae
in the sense of in eltpedz'lione would be
contrasted here with gymnastic exerciseS,
whereas Cic.‚ as Sff. points out, contrasts
the word regularly with domi, the latter
word being ‹zi-prarscd. Sff. himself pro-
posed in milz'ft'cz nero, and Lamb. militia
uero and habeam the former mode of ex-
pression is not usual in the sense of quod
nera ml mt'lz'lt'am astina, while the latter
would derive the etymological argument
from militia not srom exerrslns.

nostram dico, non spartiatarum:
though he has been dealing with the
gymnastic exercises of the Spartans in
theprevious chapter, Cic. illustrates from
the experience of the Roman rather than
