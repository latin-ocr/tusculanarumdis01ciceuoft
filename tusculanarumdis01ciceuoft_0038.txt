G (G 1). Gudianus 294, fully collated by Seyffert (Leipzig, 1864)
whose readings Ι have taken. This is 1116 only Ms (except Gr.) of
which I give the readings from any except my own collation. The first
page is written στιχηδόν, 1116 1651 are not. The Ms belongs probably
to the tenth century. It contains ΓΒ. only. For its characteristics
in detail and a comparison between this Ms and R 1 see Seyffert’s Intro-
duction. ’

G 2. Gudianus 2. “Membranaceus in s0l2'0.⁷’ Written in France,
probably in the xlvth century. Contains most of Cicero.
