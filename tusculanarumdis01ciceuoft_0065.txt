Introduction. Philosophic study is valuable: the wider the better.
The multitude ‹lislike it, and rival schools assail one another, but
Cicero as an Academic philosopher courts discussion, Q 1—5. Roman
works on philosophy written in a finished style are wanted, ξ 6.
Epicurean writers are already in the field, but few will read them
owing to their disregard of style, Q 8, 9. The series of discussions
begun on the previous day is continued on the second asternoon,
Q 10-14.

A. The proposition put forward for debate is that pain is the
greatest of evils, but, as it is immediately admitted that pain is not
a greater evil than disgrace, the proposition as amended is tlzat pain
is cm evil, ξ 14.

With some excepdons, philosophers have not taught well on this
question. Aristippus and Epicurus made pain the chief evil, Q 15, 16.
Epicurus, it is true, says that the wise man will be cheerful under
torture: but he cannot be serious in saying so, ᾗ 17. Pain is harsh‚
unnatural, hard to endure, ᾗ 18. Observe how heroes behaved when in
pain—Philoctetes, Hercules, Prometheus, Q 19-26. Poets indeed are
to blame for representing heroes as giving way to pain, ,ξ 27. But the
Epicurean philosophers are just as bad, ,ξ 28. The Stoics prove by
syllogism‚ to their own satisfaction‚ that pain is not an evil, but they
admit that it is harsh, unnatural, and hard to bear, g 29. The
Peripatetic view is better: pain is an evil, but neither this evil, nor
even all evils combined, can be compared with the evil of disgrace‚ g 30.
As it is disgraceful to groan under pain and to be prostrated by it, virtue
must overcome pain. Take the four Cardinal Virtues; each of them
is severally inconsistent with a giving way to pain, Q 31-2.

B. Pain then must be despised.

It can be overcome by enduranceQ 33.

This can be developed, 1. by practice, preparation, habituation‚
Q 34—413 2. by philosophie conviction, Q 42—65.

1. Examples of the effect of practice, etc. are afforded by the
Cretans, the Spartans, even boys and women, Roman soldiers,
Eurypylus, huntsmen‚ boxers, gladiators, Q 34—41.

2. The philosophie attitude towards pain considered.

All pain is endurable, ξ 42.

The connexion between uirtus and uir shews that the word for
courage, the preeminent virtue, has come to comprise all virtues,
