He was the first to give grounds sor his
opinion.

quod Pythagoram: the construction
is based on an ellipse offlwmzl sensisse,
but surely quod Pyllmgoras (sensisset)
would be the more natural expression.
If so, Kit'lz. non probante, this is a case of
attraction due to a desire for brevity of
expression, cf. Madv. on Fin. ii 27, 88.

an tu: for an rhetorical cf. 2, 4 n.

with subj. where it expresses a contras!
between the eontents of the leading and
those of the subordinate proposition,
‘whereas‚' ‘although,⁷ see Madv. §358
obs. 3 and cs. Ac. ii 19, 62 ‘an tu eum
res occultissimas aperueris.. negabis. .. ?’
and I<oby§ 1726 and the exX. from Off.
iii 2, 6 and Livy xxxix 36 quoted there.
After this construction the verb in the
leading proposition can stand in the
indic. and the tense depends upon the
meaning required, as in Ac. quoted above
negabis; here deseris with best MSS (also
Dav. TS. Hei. Sff. Ml. Schiche), and
there is no need to follow Mo. and
Kiih. in reading deseres with some inferior
MSS. If adduxeris were fut. exactum, as
Ktih. supposes, deseres would be neces-
sary; but it is evident that A. is already
in summ. exspect. adductus.

cum eodem isto: the emendation islo
seems necessary. illo is not so good.
{pse and isle are inore readily confused
by copyists than ipsc and ille. ipse with

errauerim: for the tense and meod see
Roby ἓ 1541, Madv. ἓ 350 b. In what

rather than Platonic.

num igitur dubitamus, ‘We are not
then in doubt (on the following point)
are we?’ ‘Can we be in doubt (on this)
as on most questions?' cm, though in
all MSS, has been bracketed or ejected

Tr. Bai. Mo. TS. Hei. It is retained

followed by an in Or. i 58, 249 ‘num

Only one or two inferior MSS have the
words sic el lzoc after pleraque. Kfih.
seems right in noting that, while et in
the sense of etiam is found in Cicero
(though rarely)‚ sicut is not followed by
