evidently correct and which are not found in the MSS os group u, hut on
the other hand, as shewn a little further on, it presents a great number
of error& Several of which are clearly due to the use os contra‹:ti0ns in
the original froin which its corrections were taken.

There is so much difference between the readings of V² and those
of the MSS of group a, that it seems probable that several stages in-
tervened between the two sources of groups α and β and their common
archetype.

The MSS of group α are obviously derived from a common source.
Ι have arranged them in the table in the order of their nearness one to
another. R and B 2 are very closely related : as also are R and L3 so
too are E and B. K is related to R but not quite so closely as either
L or B 2.

V is the most independent member of the group. It is the only
early MS that has not the words iussu tyrannorum after ponamus in
1§ 75. This MS marks the nearest point of contact between group α
and group β. Hence Ι think that it has probably been copied from an
earlier MS than that from which the other members of group α are
derived.

The inter-relationship of the most important MSS of group β is in-
dicated in the following table :—
