ξ 57 (afferrent for adferrem ⁷§¹67 esur) sint sor (sua sit. In 1 ,ξ’ lor) summis
(most MSS suWis) for suis two m’s are wrongly inserted, sonic stroke
having probably been mistaken for a symbol for m and having also
been retained over the m because the word sumnn's seemed to suit thc
meaning. M is inserted in 1 §110 salamina for salamina, the later
idiom probably contributing herc as in atquin3 11 ,ξ 3¹ relinquentem for
relinquente 3 ξ 45 breuem for breue.

1§85 uel was written for ui, ul for ui or vi for vi. Similarly in
11 ξ 62 ut was written for uel (ut). ξ 91 the reading nou moda nan may
have arisen from a copyist mistaking nan for a contractiori, cng. ἦ 77⁰2 ᾗ,
cf. the reading of R. ,ξ 93 &facta i.e. et acta for exacta. ,ξ 106 praescisset,
1 g 114 praecatione, 11 ,ξ 54 praessum : these errors are due to the use of
the same contractioris} to denote prae and pre. ξ 2 sed for si, i.e.s; for
si or SET sor SEI. ξ 3 exortus for exartum, probably from the marl< “ on
exorti} being mistaken for ſs i.e. s. The termination of genus may
have contributed. ᾗ 18 si fort( ἑ, i.e. sifiirtis est, became sisarte. ,ξ 26
nilne or nin i.e. numerum was confused with ffr or φῒνίῖ, i.e. noster. ,ξ 31
frustra has probably fallen out and an abbreviation was very likely the
cause of its loss. §32 confess'fu’is seems to have taken the place of
confeffitseris. ,ξ 33 discere for discede. ἓ 34 quarum nno mado for
quorum non modo, ’[ἳο for na. ,ξ 39 continuatus for continuatur, 5 for Ἴ,
pote' (potest) for pot( (petiis). §42 eius (⁶²2⁹) for aui Cf. the form in
V G D Π Ε 2 etc. §48 ac ad probably for atq,·‚ i.e. atque. §49 dztbitant
or dubitat misread as dubitari, i.e. dubitarunt. ,ξ 52 aninlo misread as
uero, ιΐῐο as W. §60 tanta opere for tantu apere. ,ξ 62 nt for uel (ul).
Similarly in g 54, ol) eam causam, que (ῃ) has fallen out after eam, the
contraction probably causing the loss. In 1 ξς· 30, 70 omniaque in D for
omnique probably arose out of θιξ,· which the copyist read as aian,- merely
because omnia is of more frequent occurrence than onzni. In 1 §98
iniquorum uentos seems to have arisen from writing ri} for 6⁷ch Com-
pare the reading of K.

Two very important illustrations of this error require special notice.
In 11 ξ 13 the best MSS have acinprobe or ac inprobe. This must have
arisen out of aEiprobe‚ the flat mark above the c indicating con-
traction‚ in this case due to writing a single for a double letter.
This flat mark was mistaken for the symbol which denotes the
omission of n or m and was supposed to belong to the i, hence the
MS reading. The reading of O 11 seems very significant.
