lviii JNTRODUCTJON

(b) The argument from the scale of existence. The fact
of a gradual ascent in nature from the vegetable principle of growth
to the irrational soul of the lower animals and thence to the imperfect
reason of man leads us to the doctrine of a divine being with perfect
reason, and similarly to the doctrine os an immortal soul. This
argument is begun in the latter part of5 563 but Cicero drifts from
1t into

(c) The argument from the preeminence of the powers
possessed by the solil—eg. memory, 55 57—61 3 invention, 5 623 poetic
and philosophie powers, 5' 64.

(d) In stating the argument from memory Cicero in 5 57 first
deals with ἀνάμνησις as if this were mainly noteworthy as a feat of
memor-y, whereas the argument from ἀνάμνησις is a separate argument.

Such arguments as these convinced Socrates, 55 71—73; and Cato
of Utica, 5 743 but suicide is forbidden 5 74. While we live, the soul
should constantly rise superior to the body and to all earthly concems.
This life is the real death. 5 75.

Yet the doctrine of immortality is rejected by many philosophers.
(The Stoics have a midway view, which need not detain us, nor can we
accept the arguments of Panaetius) 55 76-81.

B. Cicero therefore proceeds in 55 82-1 16 to maintain that, even if we
assume that the soul perishes at death as completely as the body,
there is no evil in death.

(a) No one asserts that if the soul perishes at death there is any
pain in the body after death, 5 82.

(b) If any pain is felt in the act of dying, that pain is only
momentary, and often there is no pain, in some cases there is even
pleasure, 5 82.

(c) It is true that people regret to leave the good things of life.
But they really leave evils, not good things. 55 83—4.

(d) Metellus might seem to have left only good things behind
at death, but the case of Priam (who might have seemed equally
fortunate had he not lived so long), and the case of Pompey serve
to shew that death removes all from possible if not from actual evil.
55 85-6. (See note on 5 85.)

(e) In view of the difficulties contained in 5 88 and my emendation
there, Ι may here state the argument of 55 87, 88 at some length, and add
a translation of the passage in 5 88 as emended. I believe that this
emendation and transposition remove all difficulties. Cicero in the
‘tusculan Disputations undertakes to prove that death is to be despised‚
whether the soul is mortal or immortal. The interlocutor admits (5 25)
that the soul is happy in death isit is immortal, and Cicero in 55 26—81
