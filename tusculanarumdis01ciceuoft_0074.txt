Polyclitus the elder, born at Sicyon,
flourished at Argos in the tirne of Periclem,
and as he was a sculptor, not a painter,
Man.. Lamb. and others have held that
Polygnotus should be read, a view ap-
proved by Bent., who compared Anthol.
Epig. iii 14; and also iv 8, where Πολυ-
κλείτου Θασίου is an error for Πολυγνώτου
Θασίου. Muretus (in Mo.) noted ‘aut
Polygnotus legendum, aut Cicero memoria
lapsus est) The theory that CiC. had
confused the two is held also by Sff.
who compares v 16, 46 Anticlea sor Eury-
clea. TS. follows Sff.

Dav. thinks that Polyclitus was a
painter as well as a sculptor3 he relies
upon Aelian V.H. xiv 8 (where Or. con-
siders the words ὁ ζωγράφος 10 be a gloss)
and on Tzetzes, Chil. VIII 320. The best
view however is that of Neidius and
FAW„ accepted by Kuh„ Hei. and
others, that Cic. takes an example from
a closely connected art.

Polyclitus⁷ most famous works were the
Δορυφόρος (sor which see Sandys on Or.
2, 5) and the chryselephantine statue of
the Argive Hera.

Parrhasius of Ephesus flourished as a
painter about 400 B.C.

honos alit. artes : Dav. compares Sen.
Ep. 102 ‘antiquus poeta ait: Laus alit
arles’; Plat. Rep. viii, p. 55¹ a ἀσκεῖται
δὴ τὸ ἀεὶ τιμώμενον, ἀμελεῖται δὲ τὸ ἀτιμα-
ζὸμενον.

incenduntur : incendimur was ap-
proved by Bent. as more elegant, and
by FAW. Aug. Ciu. Dei v 13 111
quoting this passage has ‘omnesque ac-
cenduntm·.' All three readings being
good Latin the MSS must decide.

iacent=nqgleguntm¹, cf. 3, 5 ‘philo-
sophia iacuit.’

iacentque: Kiih. points out that que
here, and often after negatives, seems to
have an adversative force but really only
introduces a continuation and enlarge-

ment of the clause to which it is attached
(here honos alit artes). Cf. 29, 71 ‘ad-
hibuitque,' where see note3 Madv. §433.

igitur : this word rarely stands first in
its clause. Usually where it does so it
introduces the conclusion of a syllogisni
as in 6, 11 where see K'uh. Cf. Madv.
on Fin. i 18, 61. Kiih. Gr. II ξ 174,
p. 734. With its use here cf. Lael. 11,
39 ‘igitur ne suspicari quidem possumus '
etc.. where see Reid's n.

et Epaminondas Themistoclesque:
wherever two clauses are connected by et
and que there is an anacolouthon. The
writer had intended to use a second
et but sorgot the first one or found, on
reaching the second clause, that it was
of less importance than the first. Cf.
Kiih. here: Madv. 011 Fin. v 22, 64;
Reid on Ac. i 12, 43.

fidibus praeclare etc.: cf. Corn. Ne-
pos, Epam. ii I.

aliquot ante annos: so most editors.
annis read by Bai. Sff. Ts. may be
right. 1f armos be wrong, aule, mistal-:en
for a preposhion, may account for the
error. The abl. of measure is the usual
constr. with anle and post and is common
in Cic. : cf. 1, 3 n.; 13, 29 ‘multis post

annis⁷3 Madv. ἓ 270; Roby ἓξ 1204 -

and 1207. ante is in any case adverbial.
The acc„ if sound‚ is due to the idea of
going back (in thought) over a number
of years. Ciceronian instances are very
rare:——In p. Rosc. Am. 44, 128 quoted
in Kiih. Gr. 11 ξ 81 p. 297, · aliquot post
menses 61 1101110 occisus est et bona
uenisse dicuntur‚' the sact that two events
are mentioned which would occur at
different points of time may perhaps
account for the inaccuracy; Phil. v 19,
52 ‘ut L. Egnatuleio triennium ante
legitimum tempus magistratus petere
liceat.> In Or. ii 67, 273 ‘aliquot post
annos' Wilkins reads the abl. In Cato
M. 6, 16 ‘septem et decem annos post
