xxxvi INTROD UCTION

copied from an excellent source. This source may have been an uncial
MS as the words in the original were not separate. Β 2 is very closely
related to R and possibly copied from the same original. The original
of R was beginning to go to pieces when R was copied from it. The
original of Β 2 had fallen still more to pieces by the time that B 2 was
written. B 2 omits fron] 11 Q 45 ego slmlmnm dolorem to 111 Q 12 ‘minime'

decumbere, 11 Q 41, to sin antem caderet, 111 Q 19, is out of place. This
includes the passage lost from B 2 and two or three leaves besides. If
both Mss are copies ofthe same original, that original had been stitched
up after R was copied and had subsequently fallen very much to pieces.

it is referred to the ninth century. It is written on parchment in light
brown ink, 220 millimetres by 193. The words are very much run
together, this being probably an indication that the MS has been
directly copied from an uncia] MS. Contractions are inuch inore
freely used than in R V or G. The book consists of 46 double pages
and two single pages, the first and last. It contains the Tusculan
Disputations only. There is no ornamentation whatever. Corrections
have been made, some in brown ink, perhaps of the same date as the
MS, others in dark brown ink, and in a sornewhat later hand; and
