wanted however is that os Sff„ i.e. ‘which
of the two it is I do not know‚’ for he
¹ goes on to say lower down ‘but whether
it is air or whether it is tire Ι would
swear that it is divine.'
ut istos: i.e. all those who, like the
Stoics, held positive doctrines about the
composition of the soul.
nec me pudet...fateri nescire: sor the
omission of me before nescire cf. Madv.
§401 ; Roby§ 1346· A personal pronoun
as subject acc. is sometimes omitted before
an infin.‚ is uneinphatiC‚ especially when
it has been expressed with the verb upon
which the intin. depends, and that verb is
a verb of saying or thinking. Cf. Or. iii

‘puderet me dicere non intellegere.'

know'; sor the subj. see Madv. ξ 364
obs. 1; cf. Ac. ii 25, 81 ‘at 1116 nescio
qui, qui in scholis nominari solet, mille
et octoginta stadia quod abesset uidebat‚’
where Reid notes ‘subjunctive due to the
class-notion.’

iuud. does not go with affirmare but,
somewhat loosely‚ with iurarem. The
word is required for emphasis

adfirmare, ‘to make a positive asser-
tion'; this Cic., as a follower of the New
Academy‚ could not do, cf. Ac. ii 3, 8
‘nos (Academici) probabilia multa habe-
mus, quae sequi facile, adfirmare uix
possumus.’ See also T.D. ii 2, 5. pos-
sem of the MSS is therefore right.

siue ignis sit: for the tense, for which,
coming as it does between possem and
iurarem and being subordinate to iurarem,
we might have expected the imperfect
by attraction, cf. Fin. i 7, ²5 ‘nam si
conceffretur, etiam si ad corpus nihil
referatur, ista sua sponte et per se esse
iucunda, per se esset et uirtus et cognitio
rerum, quod minime ille uolt, expetenda‚'
where see Madv. who adds ‘Videtur
ipsam rem controuersam uniuersius elo-
qui uelle.' Cf. also Diu. ii 59, 122 ‘atqui,
ne si nauigare quidem uelim, ita guber·

in the case of indirect questions dependent
upon a non-sulfilled protasis 01· apodosis‚
the principle (os attraction) is subject to
numerous exceptions. §fil re-wrote this
passage as follows: ‘illud, si ulla alia de
re obscura, adfirmare possum, siue anima
siue ignis sit animus, cam iurare mc esse
diuinam.' But possum adfirmare iurare
meis a strange mode of expression, and
no correction is necessary. Cic. has been
speaking of memoria. it is true. but
animus includes memoria. and he there-
fore makes his assertion with regat-d to
animus. Moreover the argument along
here is that the animus, since it contains
such marvellous facuhies, memory ancl
others (cf. ξ 61 note on ‘quid illa uis ')
must he immortal.

quid enim introduces, as often, a
reductio ad absurdum.. So qnid {gitur
(ἓ 61) and quid ergo, often. The ex-
pression is equivalent to neque enim
terra...roncrela tibi uidebitur lanta uis
memoriae. Kiih.

terrane tibi hoc: Or. with vulg. read
tibi aut hoc, which seems to have no MS
authority. The insertion of aut arose
from a desire to find a separate mention
of the fourth element, aqua. But Cic. in
this-sentence sunwnart'ly rejects the two
elements ofdowmrtard lmzdmcy (cf. ξ 42),
and the dense lower air as well, leaving
only pure anima and ignis as the possible
components of the soul. [Probably e ter-
mne should be read here. Cf. ex hacine
terrena natura concreta and ἕ 66,]
