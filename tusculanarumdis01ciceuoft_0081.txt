facillime, quid ueri simillimum esset, inueniri posse Socrates
arbitrabatur. sed quo commodius disputationes nostrae expli-
centur, sic eas exponam, quasi agatur res, non quasi narretur.

ergo ita nascetur exordium:

V. 9. A.

Malum mihi uidetur esse mors.

M. Iisne, qui mortui sunt, an iis, quibus moriendum est?

A. Vtrisque.

ΑΙ. Est miserum igitur, quoniam malurn.

A . Certe.

M. Ergo et ii, quibus euenit iam, ut morerentur, et ii,

quibus euenturum est, miseri.

curate. strictly it should be ‘haec enim
ratio contra alterius opinionem disserendi
uetus et Socratica ratio est.'

disserendi: gen. of contents or defi-
nition; cf. Madv. ἓ 286, Robyg 13023 also
called ιξωινείὶιιιις appositionalz's Draeger
Ι ἓ 202. Cf. ‘nomen carendi' 36, 87 n.

quid ueri simillimum esset. : the N ew
Academy sought probabilia, not believing
certainty to be attainable. For the ques-
tion whether Socrates believed positive
knowledge attainable and sor the opinion
held in Cicero's day with regard to his
views see Reid on Ac. ii 23, 74.

V. ξ 9. The initials A. and M. have
given rise to much discussion. Obviously
they must be abbreviations which the
text is supposed to explain. A. therefore
cannot stand for Atticus, although, ac-
cording to Dav., codd. Eliens. i and ii
have Atticus, and Lactantius, Diu. Inst.
i 15, refers to Atticus as the person ad-
dressed here. For Atticus is not any-
where mentioned as present at the dis-
putations, and if Ο. Ε. Schmidt’s careful
and clear reasoning as to the dates of the
several letters be correct it follows that
Atticus must have been in Rome to re-
ceive Att. xiii 44 after the disputations
had commenced. Moreover, as pointed
out by Fr. Fabricius, Atticus, at that
time 65 years old, could not be the
adulescens of ii 1², 28. Many, induced
by the passage last referred t0‚ have taken
A. to mean adulescens and M. magister,
and these ternis have the merit of being
Ciceronian‚ though magas-ter would apply
rather to the conductor of a ludus than to
the director of a philosophical discussion.

The most obvious explanation is that
which makes A.=Auclil0r‚ cf. ‘is qui
audire uellet' of the previous ἓ, and
M. :lilarcus, cf. ‘ego‘ of the previous ξ.
But Hei. objects to the latter that the
praenomen was only used in intimate
(liscourse.

The objection however loses its weight
and the discussion most of its importance
if, as seems certain, these initials form no
part of the original text. They are ab·
sent from most MSS. In G they do not
occur in Book Ι after reuoluat-is codem in
i 6, ι2; they are several times omitted
within the short space in which they
occur; and once (at imple sane) M. stands
by error for A. From iii 7, 9 ‘poposci
eorum aliquem qui aderant causam dis-
serendi‚’ it may perhaps be inferred that
A. was not necessarily the same person
throughout the five days’ discussion.

[Some mode of distinguishing the in-
terlocutors there must have been, and
as the principal is thoroughly identified
with Cicero, see e.g. 5, 32, it is hardly
likely he was designated by a general
title such as magister. About the other
interlocutor there is nothing more in-
dividual than what is found in 2 ἓ 26, which
is not much]

miserum: used here for the sake of
symmetry to balance malum, though not
established as a substantive as bonum and
malum were. See Kiih„ who compares
Fin. v 28, 84 ‘bonum liberi; misera
orbitas. ..bonum ualetudo; miser morbus‚⁷
etc.

ma1um=an evil objectively ; miserum
is subjective.
