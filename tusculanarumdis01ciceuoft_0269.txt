srom that of the Spartan soldier because

347). 1111116 1116 Spartan when on cam-

iter and ac are 81³st brilliant emenda-
tions. iter (iffi) was omitted by 11111110-
graphy after -2'l in plvcstdz'l, and ad
modum, written admodum, was mistaken
sor the adverb and so led to the changing
of ac to (ια’. αι’ 15 1116 reading of G 2.
Sff. cites val. Max. ii 6, 2 ‘Lacedaemo-
niorum exercitus non ante ad dimicandum
descendere solebant, quam tibiae con-
centu (cf. ad libiam) et anapaesti pedis
modulo (cf. acl modum) cohortationis
calorem animo traxissent.' Lamb. had
arrived at the same meaning by reading
procedit agmen ad modum ad tibiam.
Schiche reads procedit acies acl modum
tibicinum.

tibiam: the Spartans marched to the
sound of the flute, not to that os the
trumpet3 cf.Th11c. v 703 Plut. ch.
22, 3 ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐξῆρχεν ἐμβατηριου
παιανος ὥστε σεμνὴν ἅμα καὶ καταπλη-
κτικὴν τὴν ὄψιν εἶναι ῥιθμῷ πρὸς τὸν
αὐλὸν ἐμβαινόντων. Mttller, Dormns It
346. The flute-players formed a heredi-
tary class at Sparta, Herod. vi 60.

anapaestis pedibus: Neidins quotes
two lines of an ἐμβατήριον 111 anapaestic
metre from Hephaestion Alexandrinus:
ἄγετ’ ὦ Σπάρτας ἔνοπλοι κοῦροι, ποτὶ τὰν
’Ἄρεως κίνασιν.

qui labor, quantus agminis: Ι have
not found a close parallel to this asynde-
ton, yet the expression would be less im-
pressive if with several editors (Mo. TS.
Hei. Schiche) we were to insert el. Krih.
observes ‘asyndeton in gradatione aptis-
simum est.’

plus dimidiati mensis: in Caes. Β. C.
i 78 the soldiers arc ordered to carry 22
‹lays' provisions: in Livy xlix· 2, 4 0116
111011111’5 provisions: in Livy 131111. 57,
30 days' provisions and 7 stakes apiece.
l‘lut., Flamininus 5, 2, refers to the Ro-
man soldiers abstaining from plundering
though their month's rations had not
been served out to them. Cf. Vegetius i
19 ‘pondus quoque baiulare usque ad
lx libras et iter facere, gradu militari.’
From t‘lut. Mar. 13,1 it seems to follow
that the soldiers did not alu ays carry all
111611 baggage thenis eive.- l'lutareh as-
56115 that u hen Marius compellerl them
to do so the name of‘ Marius' mules'
became proverbial sor all those who
obeyed severe orders without grumbling.
Plutarch, however, as Dr Reid points out,
completely misunderstood the phrase
muli lllttrz'am‘. [Cf. Frontinus, Strateg.
4, 1 g* 7 ‘C. Marius recidendorum im-
pedimentorum gratia, quibus maxime
exercitus agmen oneratur, uasa et cibaria
militum in fasciculis aptata furcis 1111-
posuit, 5111) quibus et habile onus et facilis
requies esset. unde et in prouerbium
tractum est ε muli Mariani) The res. in
Festus 149 is 10 1116 same effect. It was
the device wh. was called mulus, not
the soldiers. In camp language animal
names were applied to many devices-
See also Paul. ex Fest. s.u. aerumnulas:
‘aerumnulas Plautus refert furcillas (1111-
bus religatas sarcinas uiatores ferebant.
quorum 11511111 quia C. Marius rettulit
muli Mariani postea appellabantur.’]

plus: qnam is more often omitted than
expressed with specifications of time and
measure, ef. Sest. 39, 85 ‘plus uiginti
uolneribus acceptis⁷; Caes. B. G. i38, 5
‘spatium non amplius pedum sescento-
rum’; BG. v 53, 7 ‘longius milia
passuum octo.'

non plus numerant, ‘they do not
reckon as anything more than,' ‘they
reckon as little as.' Madx'. 305 obs. 2.
