TVSCVLANARVM DISPVTATIONVM

LIBER PRIMVS.

Ι. 1. CVM defensionum laboribus senatoriisque muneribus

The words De contemnenda morte,
found in most early editions aster 'the
title of the book, are not in the best
MSS and do not belong to Cic.‚ but have
been introduced into inferior MSS from
Diu. ii 1, 2 ‘totidem subsecuti libri “Tus-
culanarum disputationum ³³. . primus enim
est de contemnenda morte, secundus de
tolerando dolore..)

Ι. §L defensionum: most of Cicero’s
extant speeches were delivered sor the
defence. He appeared in the law—courts
on the side of the prosecution in the case
of Verres; cf. Or. 29, ¹03 (and Sandys’
note) ‘in accusationis septem libris.'
The interrogation of Vatinius arose out
of the defence of Sestius. The invective
against Piso and most of those against
Catiline and M. A0ntonius were delivered
before the Senate, the rest before the
people.

aut...aut‚ ‘either...or at all events.'
46, 110 ‘aut summum bonum aut...
nullum malum'3 v 30, 84 ‘nihil bonum,
nisi naturae primis bonis aut omnibus
aut maximis frui.' See Hand, Tursell. 1
P· 532·

magna. ex parte: between the out-
, break of the Civil War and the publi-
cation of the Tusculan Disputations the
only speeches delivered by Cic. were
pro All. Marcello aud pro Q. Ligario in
46 B.C.‚ and pro rege Deiotaro in 45 B.C.

D.

reiuli B 3.
Η animo retenta w 1.

re tuli O 5 altero t eraso.

cum essem: subj. because the order
of succession in time is also the order of
cause and effect. Cf. Madv. ξ 358.

aliquando, ‘at last‚’ implying that the
time of release was all too long in coming.
Cf. 44, 105 ‘aliquando sapiens Achilles!
So tandem aliquando and tandem.

Brute: see Introd. end os section 1.

retenta animo: Cicero's attention had
been early directed to philosophy. By
the year 88 B.C. he had studied under the
Epicurean Phaedrus, Diodotus the Stoie‚
and Philo of Larissa. See Reid’s Introd.
to the Academics, pp. 1, 2. [Compare
inclusa habebam Ac. i 3, 11.]

remissa. temporibus: abl. ‚of cause,
‘less vigorously prosecuted owing to
circumstances.⁷ tempora is often applied
to circumstances of difficulty or danger.
Cicero's poem de Temporibus Aleis dealt
with the circumstances of his exile and
recall. Cf. pro Plancio 1, 1 ‘ meorum tern-
porum’; cf. also the use os tempus in
p. Sest. 6, 145 58, 1²3· Here the refer-
ence is probably wider and covers the
period of Cicero's tenure of state office
and Subsequent activity at the bar.

mtermissa: between 52 ΚΕ. and
46 B.C.‚ the interruption being due to
his administration of Cilicia and to the
Civil W'ar, cf. Teuffel, Rom. Lit. 1 § 173
subsec. α, 1.
