cum cantu moriantur ε cf. Plato, Phacdo
84 e, 85 b ’καί, ὡς ἔοικε. τῶν κύκνων
δοκῶ φαυλότερος ὑμῖν εἶναι τὴν μαντικήν,
οἳ ἐπειδὰν αἴσθωνται ὅτι δεῖ αὐτοὺς ἀπο-
θανεῖν, ᾅδοντες καὶ ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν χρόνῳ,
τότε δὴ πλεῖστα καὶ μάλιστα ᾅδουσι,
γεγηθότες ὅτι μέλλουσι παρὰ τὸν θεὸν
ἀπιέναι οὗπερ εἰσὶ θεράποντες ...... τοῦ
’Λπόλλωνος ὄντες μαντικοὶ τέ εἰσι καὶ
προειδότες τὰ ἐν ’Ἃιδου ἀγαθὰ ᾅδουσι καὶ
τέρπονται ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν διαφερόντως
ἦ τῷ ἔμπροσθεν χρόνῳ.’ The opinion
widely prevalent among the ancients,
that the dying swan sings, is denied by
Pliny, H. N. x ²3 ‘olorum in morte
narratur flebilis cantio: falso, ut arbitror
aliquot experimentis·' See also Sir T.
Browne, Vuljgar Errors 111 27. The
theory, with numerous connected points,
is well discussed by Geddes in an ex-
cursus to Phaedo, as above, note O.
ut cygm...: we have here an anaco-
louth0n‚ the interposition of the explana-
tory clauses sed quod...l)oni sit having
caused the thread of the construction to
be lost as in 17, 40 ‘num igitur dubita-
mus...terram’; 36, 88 ‘confirmato illo‚’
where see notes. cygni is nom. to
prout-
dentes we should strictly have had qua
prom'deant. Davies’ conj. quasi for qua
is impossible, since prouz'dentes does not

ξ involve a metaphor requiring modifica-
ἶ 11011 or apology.

Moreover there is not
any similar qualification in the Greek,
quoted above. Reiske and others supply
faciunt (faciant) to cygni from the fol-
lowing faciendum.

usu uenit: uenit is here perfect, other-

wise we should have amittant not
amium-ent. Or. holds that the expres-
sion nst] ueni! arose 110111 usus usnil,
common in old Latin, and that, the final
s being almost silent in pronunciati0n‚
usu’ came to be regarded as an abl..
usu uenit being z casu arcidz'l3 Otto on
the other hand thinks usu was in origin
the contracted dative usm' and that usu
uenit = usui se ffert (oblulz'l).

qui cum acriter...intuerentur‚ utam:
if we read as in the text with almost all
MSS including the best, we have an
anacolouthon‚ as we should strictly have
had quod eis saepe usu uenit qui arriter. ..
inmiti sunt, ut aspectum omnino amil-
terent, or quod eis saepe usu ueni! qui
cum...intmrentum aspectum omnino ami-
serunt. The subj. indueremur follows
cum temporal because the order of
succession in time is also in this case an
order of cause and effect, ef. Madv.
ξ 558. Schiche substitutes uel for ut.
If uel were read or ut were absent
before aspectum we should have no
anacolouthon. ut is said to be absent
from two inferior MSS and might be
thought to have come in by dittography
after -ur, but we should expect amiserunt
not amitterent if ut were absent, and Mo.
is probably right in supposing that the
omission is due to a corrector.

cum before acriter is absent from at
least one inferior MS and omitted from
several early editions. cum is bracketed
by Bai. and TS. and by Klotz, following
Madv. Wes. Hei. If this were accepted
it would seem impossible to explain the
subj. intuerentur except as iterative. But,
