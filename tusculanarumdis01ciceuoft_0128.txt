that Theophrastus' words were πατρῷος
καὶ παππῷος, as in Demosthenes. Cic.
perhaps wished to reproduce the Gk
identity of termination. The reference
is to the early physicists‚ Thales etc.

philosophiam incensam : Neidius conj.
incensa but Mo. replies ‘cum philosophia
sit sapientiae amor cur eum amorem non
dicat incensum esse cognitionis cupiditate
omnibus hominibus insita?'

dispicere, ‘to pierce the gloom.' Much
used of making effort to see through
obstacles‚ eg. scales over the eyes, Fin.
iv 23, 54, v 15, 4: or mist, as when one
swoons, Fin. ii 30, 97 (of Epaminondas,
mortally wounded) ‘ut primum dispexit’3
or an unsavourable medium, as here.

XX. aliquid: something definita
hence often as here something consider-
able ; ‘they think they reap some results.’
Cf. iv 20, 46 ‘nihilne tibi uidentur an
aliquid (licere?’ iii 16, 35; v 36, 104;
JUV. i 73 ‘si uis esse aliquid' ; Prop. iv 7,
1 ‘sunt aliquid manes.⁷ So, more rarely‚
aliquis, aliquem. This use is especially
found with esse. dicere, uideri. Similarly
in Greek τις and τι, cf. Liddell and Scott‚
sub nore.

adsequi: Kiih. is probably right in
explaining this as a pres. of abiding re-
sult of past action. Cf. Gram. 11 p. 89
ἓ 31, 5. This use is more common in
Livy, e.g. m'nccrezuictor esse. Cf. K'uh-
nast‚ Liv. Synt. ξ 208; and in the poets
cf. edunt Virg. Ecl. 8, 45; creat Geo. i
279; dat Aen. ix 266. So in Gk φεύγειν,

ii 1, 2 ‘qui...mortem non timet magnum

delecti: the form dilecti is adopted by
Bai. K'uh. Hei. TS. and may very possibly
be right. The evidence of the MSS seems
rather in favour'of delecti, but the reading
of V may have been tampered with. The
passage is from Ennius‘ Medea, repro-
ducing Eur. Med. 5 ἀνδρῶν ἀριστέων, οἳ
τὸ πάγχρυσον δέρας.... Ennius may have
used dilectus in the sense of ‘caresully
chosen’ though the word seems not to
occur elsewhere in this sense; but cf.
ιίίίῑζξεηίία. Ν1116 lines are quoted by the
Auctor ad Herennium ii 22, 35, and he
and Priscian de Metr. Com. p. 1325
quote these lines thus :>— ‘ Argo qua uecti
Argiui ; delecti uiri, petebant illam
pellem inauratam arietis) Cicero, as
often, does not quote the lines quite
accurately. arietis scanned dryetz's
(dactyl).

Europam Libyamque: the Straits of
Gibraltar are referred to. This line,
from Enn. Annales, occurs again N.D.
iii 10, ²4- See Vahlen p. 45 for its
source, Ann. ix frag. 3.
